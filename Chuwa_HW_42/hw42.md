4.  what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
    JPA (Java Persistence API) is a standard Java specification for object-relational mapping (ORM), allowing Java applications to interact with relational databases using object-oriented paradigms.

    Hibernate is a popular and widely used ORM framework in Java that implements the JPA specification. It simplifies database interactions, enabling developers to work with databases using object-oriented concepts, making it easier to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
5.  What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
    Hikari is a fast and lightweight connection pool used in Java applications to manage database connections efficiently.
    Benefits of Connection Pooling:
    Resource Management: Reduces the overhead of opening and closing database connections.
    Improved Performance: Reuses connections, saving time and resources.
    Reduced Latency: Minimizes delays in database access for faster responses.
    Scalability: Allows handling more concurrent database requests effectively.
    Connection Recycling: Monitors and maintains healthy connections.
    Customization: Offers configuration options for optimal performance.
6.  What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
    it describes the relationship between entities.
    Employee to department is many to one, department to employee is one to many
    Student to professor is many to many
7. What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what
are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose
which one?
    CascadeType.PERSIST: The persist operation cascades to related entities. When the parent entity is persisted, the related entities are also persisted.

    CascadeType.MERGE: The merge operation cascades to related entities. When the parent entity is merged, the related entities are also merged.

    CascadeType.REFRESH: The refresh operation cascades to related entities. When the parent entity is refreshed, the related entities are also refreshed with data from the database.

    CascadeType.DETACH: The detach operation cascades to related entities. When the parent entity is detached, the related entities are also detached from the persistence context.
    CascadeType.ALL: When you want to automatically manage the persistence of related entities, ensuring that changes to the parent entity are propagated to its associated child entities.

    CascadeType.PERSIST: When you want to persist newly created entities along with their parent entity, ensuring that child entities are saved automatically.

    CascadeType.MERGE: When you want to propagate changes made to detached entities back to their associated parent entity, allowing easy synchronization of changes.

    CascadeType.REMOVE: When you want to automatically delete child entities when they are no longer associated with the parent entity (with orphanRemoval = true).
8.  What is the  fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the
difference? In which situation you choose which one?
    fetch = FetchType.LAZY:
    With FetchType.LAZY, the related entities are not loaded from the database until they are explicitly accessed or fetched. In other words, the related entities are loaded lazily when needed. This can help improve performance by reducing unnecessary database queries when the related data is not required for a particular operation.

    fetch = FetchType.EAGER:
    With FetchType.EAGER, the related entities are loaded immediately along with the main entity during the initial query. This means that all the related data is fetched eagerly when the main entity is retrieved from the database. Eager fetching can simplify coding, as it ensures that all related data is available upfront, but it may lead to performance issues if the related data is not always needed.

9.  What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by
ourselves? Could you list some examples?
Entity Class Name: The entity class name should be in camel case and correspond to the name of the database table it maps to. For example, if the entity class is Person, it is assumed to map to a table named person.

Database Table Name: By default, JPA uses the entity class name as the table name. However, you can customize the table name using the @Table annotation if needed.

Primary Key Attribute: The primary key attribute in an entity class should be named id. JPA assumes that an attribute named id represents the primary key of the corresponding table.

Database Column Name: By default, JPA uses the attribute name as the column name in the database. For example, if an attribute in the entity class is named firstName, it is assumed to map to a column named firstName in the database table. Again, you can customize the column name using the @Column annotation if needed.

Relationships: The name of the attribute representing a relationship between entities should reflect the name of the related entity or its collection in the plural form. For example, if an entity Order has a many-to-one relationship with Customer, the attribute representing the relationship can be named customer.

10. Try to use JPA advanced methods in your class project. In the repository layer,
you need to use the naming convention to use the method provided by JPA.
11. (Optional) Check out a new branch(https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-red
book/tree/hw02_01_jdbcTemplate) from branch 02_post_RUD, replace the dao
layer using JdbcTemplate.
12. (Optional) use JDBC to read the data from database.
13. type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD,
name the new branch with https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/
tree/hw05_01_slides_JPQL.
14. What is JPQL?
    JPQL stands for Java Persistence Query Language. It is a query language specific to the Java Persistence API (JPA) for querying entities stored in a relational database. JPQL is similar to SQL (Structured Query Language) but operates at a higher level, dealing with entity objects rather than database tables and columns
15. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
    @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries are annotations in JPA (Java Persistence API) that allow you to define named queries for entity classes. Named queries are pre-defined queries that can be referred to by their names instead of writing the query in-line each time you need it. This provides a cleaner and more maintainable way to manage queries in your JPA-based application.
16. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
    In JPA (Java Persistence API), @Query is an annotation provided by Spring Data JPA that allows you to define custom queries using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL directly in your repository interfaces. It provides a way to write custom database queries that are not covered by the standard query methods provided by Spring Data JPA.
17.  What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
    HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and Criteria Queries are two query mechanisms provided by Hibernate, a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. Both mechanisms allow you to perform database queries and retrieve data from the database using Hibernate's object-oriented approach.
18. What is EnityManager?
    EntityManager is a core interface in JPA (Java Persistence API) used to interact with the database. It manages the cache of entities, allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and handles transactions. It's the primary way to work with entities in a JPA-based application.
19. What is SessionFactory and Session?
    SessionFactory:
    SessionFactory is a factory class in Hibernate that creates and manages Session instances. It holds configuration and mapping information.

    Session:
    Session represents a single unit of work with the database. It performs database operations and should be closed after use. Each thread should have its own Session.
20. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
    In the context of databases, a transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that a set of related database operations either all succeed (commit) or all fail (rollback) together. This concept is essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity in a database system.
21. What is hibernate Caching?
22. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
    Hibernate caching is a mechanism that stores frequently accessed data in memory to improve application performance. There are two levels of caching:
    Level 1 Cache (Session Cache): Associated with a single session, stores entities for quick retrieval during that session.
    Level 2 Cache (Second-Level Cache): Shared cache across sessions, reduces repeated database queries for common data.
23. How do you understand @Transactional? (不要clone，要自己抄写并测试
transactional，https://github.com/TAIsRich/tutorial-transaction)
    @Transactional is an annotation in Spring Framework used to define the boundaries of a database transaction. When you annotate a method or a class with @Transactional, Spring automatically handles the transaction management for that method or class.
24. Write a simple factory design pattern.
