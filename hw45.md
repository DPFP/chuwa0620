2.  What is the authentication?
3.  What is the authorization?
4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
    authentication is about confirming the identity of a user, while authorization is about determining what actions and
    resources the authenticated user is allowed to access.
5.  What is HTTP Session?
    HTTP Session is a mechanism that enables web applications to maintain stateful interactions with users across multiple 
    requests. It assigns a unique identifier (session ID) to each user's session and stores data related to the session on 
    the server. This allows the application to remember user-specific information and provide a personalized experience.
6.  What is Cookie?
    A cookie is a small text file stored on a user's device by a web browser when they visit a website. It remembers 
    information about the user's interactions with the site and is used for session management, tracking, and personalization on the web.
7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
   a session is used to maintain stateful interactions between a user and a web application on the server-side, while 
   a cookie is a small data file stored on the client-side by the web browser to remember specific information about the 
   user or their interactions with a website.
8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
    application?
    Session Management:

When a user logs in or starts a session, the server creates a unique session ID and stores user-specific data (e.g., user ID, name, permissions) on the server-side associated with that session ID.
The server sends the session ID back to the client, usually as a cookie in the HTTP response header.
The client's browser stores the session ID as a cookie.
With each subsequent request, the client automatically sends the session ID cookie back to the server in the HTTP request header.
The server uses the session ID to retrieve the relevant session data and identify the user.

Using Cookies for Persistent Information:
If there are specific user preferences or settings that need to persist across sessions (even after the user closes the browser), you can use persistent cookies.
The server sets a persistent cookie by specifying an expiration date for the cookie.
The client's browser stores the persistent cookie, and it will be sent back to the server with each request until the expiration date is reached.
This allows the server to remember the user's preferences or settings, providing a personalized experience each time the user visits the website.
9.  What is JWT?
    JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact and secure way of transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is 
    commonly used for user authentication and sharing data in web applications. JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, 
    and signature. It is often used for stateless authentication, authorization, and single sign-on scenarios. The token 
    is digitally signed, ensuring data integrity and security.
10. What is the spring security filter?
    In Spring Security, a filter is a component that processes incoming requests and responses for security-related tasks, 
    such as authentication, authorization, and session management. The filter chain contains a sequence of these filters, 
    each responsible for a specific security operation. It enforces security policies and protects web applications from potential 
    threats and vulnerabilities.
11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
    Token Creation: When a user logs in or authenticates, the server generates a JWT containing the user's information (payload) and signs it using a secret key known only to the server. The token consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature, each encoded in Base64 URL-safe format.

Token Issuance: The server sends the JWT back to the client as a response to a successful authentication request. The client stores the JWT securely, typically in browser storage (e.g., localStorage, sessionStorage) or as an HTTP-only cookie.

Token Usage: For subsequent requests to protected resources, the client includes the JWT in the request headers (usually in the "Authorization" header as a Bearer token) or as a cookie in the request.

Token Verification: When the server receives a request with the JWT, it validates the token's integrity by verifying the signature using the same secret key used for token creation. If the signature is valid, it means the token has not been tampered with.

Token Payload Access: After successful verification, the server decodes the JWT's payload, extracting user details and any additional information (e.g., user roles, permissions). The server can use this information to identify the user and make authorization decisions.

Authorization and Access Control: Based on the user information extracted from the JWT, the server checks whether the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. If the user is authorized, the server fulfills the request; otherwise, it returns an appropriate error response.

Token Expiration: JWTs often have an expiration time (claim) specified in the payload. The server can use this claim to enforce session timeout and force users to re-authenticate after a certain period.

14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
    Server-Side Resource Consumption: Sessions are typically stored on the server, and each active session requires server memory and processing resources. As the number of active users increases, server memory usage can become a concern.

Session Replication and Failover: In a clustered environment, session replication is needed to ensure session data is synchronized across multiple servers. This adds complexity and may lead to additional network overhead.

Session Invalidation and Management: Managing session expiration, session timeouts, and session invalidation can be challenging. Unused or expired sessions need to be properly cleaned up to avoid resource waste.

Session Affinity and Load Balancing: Sticky sessions (also known as session affinity) may be required in a load-balanced environment to ensure subsequent requests from the same client go to the same server, potentially limiting load balancing effectiveness.

To overcome the disadvantages of sessions, some strategies can be employed:

Use Stateless Authentication: Consider using stateless authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) instead of traditional server-side sessions. JWTs store user information in the token itself, eliminating the need for server-side storage and session management.

Store Session Data in a Centralized Cache: Instead of storing session data on individual servers, use a centralized cache or distributed caching system (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store session information. This allows for better scalability and easier session management.

Set Short Session Expiration Times: Set relatively short session expiration times to limit the time sessions occupy server resources. Users will need to re-authenticate after their sessions expire, but this helps keep resource consumption in check.

Implement Token-Based Authentication for APIs: For APIs, use token-based authentication mechanisms like OAuth, which eliminates the need for server-side sessions and allows for more scalable API architectures.

Use Session Replication and Failover Strategically: If session replication is necessary, carefully assess the trade-offs and consider using sticky sessions only when absolutely required to maintain session state.

Implement Cleanup Mechanisms: Implement mechanisms to clean up unused or expired sessions regularly to avoid resource wastage.
15. how to get value from application.properties?
    app.name=My Spring Boot App

    @Value("${app.name}")
    private String appName;

    private Environment environment;
    String appName = environment.getProperty("app.name");
16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

    configure(HttpSecurity http): Defines security rules and configurations for request authorization.
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Configures user authentication mechanisms and providers.

17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
     pring Security handles both authentication (verifying the identity of users) and authorization (determining what actions users are allowed to perform) to secure your Java web application. It provides a comprehensive and customizable security solution that helps protect your application from unauthorized access and potential security threats.
