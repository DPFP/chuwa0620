3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
    Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming technique that supports the separation of cross-cutting concerns
    in order to increase modularity.
    AOP is typically used to implement cross-cutting concerns, which implies that it defines functionality that is required
    in multiple places across an application in one place. You can add new functionality before or after a method is executed
    like transaction management, logging or security which cut across multiple types and objects (often termed crosscutting concerns).

4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

    Advantages of Spring AOP:
    It is easy to configure.
    Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required.
    It utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
    Can create aspects using @AspectJ annotation based or using XML based.
    It integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes,.
    Disadvantages of Spring AOP:
    Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge.
    Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
    Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation),
    Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied

5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
    An aspect is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts. A standard class tagged with the @Aspect
    annotation can be used to implement an aspect.

6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
    A pointcut is an expression that chooses one or more join points at which advice is given. Pointcuts can be defined
    using expressions or patterns. It supports a number of expressions that correspond to the join points.

7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
    A join point is a place in the application where an AOP aspect is applied. It could also be a specific advice execution
    instance. A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.

8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
    The advice is an action which we take before or after the method execution. In the Spring AOP framework, there are five
    types of advice: before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around advice. Advice is taken at a specific join point.

10. When to use Spring Batch?
    Spring Batch is an excellent choice when dealing with large-scale data processing, managing batch jobs, performing
    data transformation and validation, ensuring fault tolerance, enabling parallel processing, and benefiting from seamless
    integration with the Spring ecosystem. Its rich feature set and extensive community support make it a robust and widely
    adopted framework for batch processing solutions.
11. How Spring Batch works?
    Job: A job in Spring Batch represents a complete batch processing task. It consists of one or more steps that need to be executed in a specific order.

    Step: A step is a single unit of work within a job. Each step represents a specific processing task, such as reading data, processing it, and writing the results.

    ItemReader: The ItemReader is responsible for reading data from a data source and providing it as input to the processing logic. Spring Batch provides various built-in ItemReaders for different data sources, such as databases, flat files, XML files, and more.

    ItemProcessor: The ItemProcessor is optional but often used for transforming or processing the data read by the ItemReader. It allows you to apply business logic or transformations to the input data before passing it to the ItemWriter.

    ItemWriter: The ItemWriter is responsible for writing the processed data to a target destination, such as a database, a file, or any other data store. Like the ItemReader, Spring Batch provides various built-in ItemWriters for different data targets.

    Chunk-oriented Processing: Spring Batch uses a chunk-oriented processing model, where it reads data in fixed-size chunks (a configurable number of items). The chunk is then passed to the ItemProcessor (if configured) and then to the ItemWriter.

    JobRepository: The JobRepository is responsible for storing metadata about the batch jobs and their execution status. It tracks the progress of the jobs, enabling fault tolerance features like restartability.

    JobLauncher: The JobLauncher is responsible for starting the execution of a job. It takes the job instance and launches its execution.

    ExecutionContext: During the execution of a job, each step maintains its execution context, which can be used to store and retrieve data across the entire job execution.

    JobExecution: When a job is launched, it creates a JobExecution instance, which represents the execution of a specific job. It contains information about the job's status, start time, end time, and any exceptions that may have occurred during execution.

    JobListeners: Spring Batch provides JobListeners, which allow you to intercept job execution events, such as before job starts, after job ends, or when a job is completed successfully or with an error.
12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
    user cron

13. What is the cron expression?
    Minute (0 - 59)
    Hour (0 - 23)
    Day of the month (1 - 31)
    Month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
    Day of the week (0 - 7 or SUN-SAT, where 0 and 7 represent Sunday)

14. What is the spring task?
    Spring task refers to the scheduling and execution of repetitive or time-based operations in a Spring application.
    It is achieved using Spring's task scheduling capabilities, allowing tasks to run at specific intervals or predetermined times.
    Tasks can be automated background jobs, batch processing, and other recurring operations. Spring provides built-in support for
    task scheduling through annotations or XML configuration, making it easy to manage and execute scheduled tasks efficiently.

15. When to use Spring task?
    when you need to schedule and execute repetitive or time-based operations in your Spring application

16. What is Filter and any filter example?
    a filter is a Java component that intercepts and processes incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses. Filters are
    part of the Java Servlet API and are used to perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks on web requests and responses.
    They provide a way to modify or enhance the behavior of web applications without changing the core application code.

17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
     an interceptor is a component that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses similar to filters,
     but it is specific to Spring's web framework. Interceptors are part of Spring's Web MVC framework and are used to
     perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks on web requests and responses. Interceptors are more tightly integrated
     with Spring's MVC architecture and provide additional features and functionalities compared to filters.
18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
    In Spring MVC interceptors, preHandle and postHandle are two methods that allow you to intercept and process HTTP requests
    before they reach the controller (preHandle) and after the controller has processed the request but before the view is rendered (postHandle

19. What is Swagger?
    Swagger is an open-source framework that allows developers to design, build, document, and consume RESTful APIs
    (Application Programming Interfaces) easily and effectively. It provides a set of tools and specifications to help
    create interactive and machine-readable API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand, test, and integrate with APIs.
