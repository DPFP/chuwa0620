3. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming technique that supports the separation of **cross-cutting concerns** in order to increase modularity.

   AOP is typically used to implement **cross-cutting concerns**, which implies that it defines functionality that is required in multiple places across an application in one place. You can add new functionality before or after a method is executed like transaction management, logging or security which cut across multiple types and objects (often termed crosscutting concerns).

4. ##### Advantages of Spring AOP

   1. It is easy to configure.
   2. Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required.
   3. It utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
   4. Can create aspects using `@AspectJ` annotation based or using XML based.
   5. It integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes,.

   ##### Disadvantages of Spring AOP

   1. Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge.
   2. Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
   3. Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation), Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.

5. *An aspect is a* **cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts***. A standard class tagged with the* `@Aspect` *annotation can be used to implement an aspect.*

6. *A pointcut is an* **expression** *that chooses one or more join points at which advice is given. Pointcuts can be defined using* **expressions or patterns**. It supports a number of expressions that correspond to the join points. 

7. *A join point is a place in the application where an* **AOP aspect** *is applied. It could also be a specific advice execution instance. A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.*

8. *The advice is an* **action which we take before or after the method execution. In the Spring AOP framework, there are five types of advice: **before***,* **after***,* **after-returning**, **after-throwing, and **around advice**. Advice is taken at a specific join point.

10. Consider an environment where users have to do a lot of batch processing. This will be quite different from a typical web application which has to work 24/7. But in classic environments it's not unusual to do the heavy lifting for example during the night when there are no regular users using your system. Batch processing includes typical tasks like reading and writing to files, transforming data, reading from or writing to databases, create reports, import and export data and things like that. Often these steps have to be chained together or you have to create more complex workflows where you have to define which job steps can be run in parallel or have to be run sequentially etc. That's where a framework like Spring Batch can be very handy. Spring Boot Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs though optimization and partitioning techniques.Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

11. In Spring batch framework, user can define jobs which can be launched by joblauncher. For each job, user can create multiple steps. Steps is the finer granularity of how this job should be processed. 

12. We can use job scheduler and config it using Cron config, job scheduler will trigger batch job launch.

13. A cron expression is *a string consisting of six or seven subexpressions (fields) that describe individual details of* the schedule.

14. Spring task is a light-weight timed task tools that allow spring application to  schedule timed mission or task without using any other dependencies.

15. When user trying to set up some routinely tasks like publish article, data crawling, back up data.

16.  Spring filter is a Component generate by the web application, with filter we can make sure request can go to target location. The most common example is JWT filter.

17. Interceptor is commonly used to detect a current user is logged in. If current request is authorized, do globalization, logging.

18. *prehandle()* – called before the execution of the actual handler

    *postHandle()* – called after the handler is executed

19. *Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them*.
