3. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): AOP is a programming paradigm that allows modularizing cross-cutting concerns (such as logging, security, and transaction management) separately from the core business logic. It enables better separation of concerns and promotes code reusability.

4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Spring AOP:
    - Advantages: Code modularity, reusability, better maintenance, and cleaner code.
    - Disadvantages: Limited support for constructor pointcuts, runtime weaving can affect performance.

5. Aspect in Spring AOP: An aspect is a modularization of a cross-cutting concern. It contains advice and pointcut declarations.

6. Pointcut in Spring AOP: A pointcut is an expression that defines which methods or join points should be intercepted by the advice.

7. Join point in Spring AOP: A join point is a specific point in the execution of a program, such as method execution, exception handling, or field access, where an aspect can be applied.

8. Advice and its types in Spring AOP:
    - Advice: The action taken by an aspect at a particular join point.
    - Types of Advice: Before advice, After Returning advice, After Throwing advice, After advice, and Around advice.

10. When to use Spring Batch: Spring Batch is used for processing large volumes of data efficiently, like batch processing in ETL, data migration, and report generation.

11. How Spring Batch works: Spring Batch divides a large data set into smaller manageable chunks and processes them sequentially or in parallel.

12. How to schedule a Spring Batch Job: Spring Batch provides various schedulers like Quartz, Spring Scheduler, and Cron to schedule batch jobs.

13. Cron expression: A cron expression is a string representing a schedule based on specific time patterns. It is used in schedulers to define the time and frequency of job execution.

14. Spring Task: Spring Task is used for scheduling tasks within an application at fixed intervals.

15. When to use Spring Task: Spring Task is suitable for simple, periodic tasks that don't require complex configuration.

16. Filter and any filter example: A filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource or on the response from a resource. Example: `javax.servlet.Filter` for logging or authentication.

17. Interceptor and its usage: Interceptor is used to intercept HTTP requests and responses. It can perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks.

18. preHandle and postHandle in Interceptor: `preHandle` method is executed before the actual controller's handler method is invoked. `postHandle` method is executed after the handler method has completed its execution.

19. Swagger: Swagger is an open-source toolset that allows you to design, build, document, and consume RESTful APIs. It provides interactive documentation and code generation capabilities.
