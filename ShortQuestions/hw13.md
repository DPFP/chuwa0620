2. What is MVC pattern?

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a software design pattern commonly used in web application development. It is a way to organize the code in a manner that allows for separation of concerns, meaning different parts of the code handle different responsibilities:

- Model: 

The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the state of the application, usually by containing the fields and the methods to manipulate the data.

- View: 

The View is responsible for rendering the Model data and presenting it to the user. It is essentially the user interface part of the application.


- Controller: 

The Controller handles the user's input and updates the Model, which then updates the View. It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.

The Spring Framework has a module called Spring MVC, which is a comprehensive MVC solution for building web applications.

In Spring MVC:

- Controllers are defined as simple classes annotated with @Controller. They handle incoming requests and create or prepare the Model.

- Views are usually defined using templates (like Thymeleaf, JSP, etc.). They use the data from the Model to generate the HTML that the client sees.

- Models are typically represented by simple POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). They can be populated by the Controller, often from data received from a database or a web form.

The DispatcherServlet is at the heart of the Spring MVC framework, which ensures that each request gets to the correct Controller.

```aidl
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("greeting", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello";
    }
}
```

3. What is Front-Controller?

The Front Controller is a design pattern in web application development where a single controller handles all requests for a website. The responsibility of this controller is to handle all application level control and initial processing of the request.

In the Spring MVC framework, the DispatcherServlet acts as the Front Controller. It receives all requests to your application and then routes them to the appropriate controllers for handling.

The responsibilities of the DispatcherServlet (Front Controller) include:

- Receiving incoming requests and capturing all the details of the request.

- Validating and processing the request by determining the appropriate handler/mapping (controllers, static resources, etc.)

- Dispatching the request to the appropriate controller.

- Handling the response returned by the controller, which can be a logical view name to render or a redirection instruction.

- Managing any unhandled exceptions by routing them to the appropriate error view or error handling component.

By centralizing request handling, the Front Controller helps maintain separation of concerns in your application and makes your application easier to manage and scale.


4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.

The DispatcherServlet is a core component in the Spring MVC framework and acts as the Front Controller. It's an actual Servlet (it extends HttpServlet), but provides additional functionality to handle Spring's infrastructure needs

Here's a simplified flow of how DispatcherServlet works:

- Receive a Request: When an HTTP request comes in, the web container routes the request to the DispatcherServlet.

- Determine the Handler: DispatcherServlet consults its HandlerMapping to determine the appropriate Controller to handle the request. HandlerMapping maps request paths or patterns to controllers.

- Invoke the Handler: The selected Controller is invoked to process the request and it returns a ModelAndView object. This ModelAndView object includes the model data (typically in the form of a map) and the name of the view that should be used to render the response.

- Process the View: The DispatcherServlet consults the ViewResolver to map the logical view name to a specific View object. ViewResolver determines the technology to be used to perform the rendering, such as JSP, Thymeleaf, or others.

- Render the View: The selected View uses the model data to render the output, which is included in the HTTP response sent back to the client.

- Exception Handling: If an exception is thrown at any point in this process, the DispatcherServlet will forward the exception to an appropriate HandlerExceptionResolver, which can generate error views or otherwise handle the exception.


This design allows Spring MVC to provide a flexible and pluggable architecture. The HandlerMapping, ViewResolver, and other components can be customized or replaced to suit the needs of the application.


5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView?(please google to have a basic knowlege)

- JavaServer Pages (JSP):

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used to develop interactive web pages that are platform-independent. It's a server-side technology that allows developers to embed Java code directly into HTML or XML files. This Java code gets executed whenever a request is made for the JSP file, and the resulting HTML or XML data is sent to the client.

JSP is similar to PHP, but instead uses the Java programming language. It's part of the Java EE standard and leverages the full power of the Java language and platform, including the ability to use all the Java APIs and pull in data from databases via JDBC, interact with other Java applications, and more.

- ModelAndView:

In Spring MVC, ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. This class is used by the DispatcherServlet to select an appropriate view technology.

The Model is a map containing data that the view will use to generate the HTML. It's essentially the data that the application works with and can be a simple object or a complex structure.

The View is the component responsible for rendering the HTML to be sent to the client. In Spring MVC, the view is usually specified by a String that represents the logical view name, and is resolved by a ViewResolver implementation.
```
@Controller
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public ModelAndView sayHello() {
        ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();
        mav.addObject("greeting", "Hello, World!"); // add data to the model
        mav.setViewName("hello"); // specify the view
        return mav;
    }
}
```

In this example, when a GET request is made to "/hello", the sayHello method is invoked. It creates a ModelAndView object, adds a "greeting" to the model, and sets the view name to "hello". The view name would typically be the name of a template file in your application, such as "hello.jsp" or "hello.html".


6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间， 知道servlet的名字就行。)

Servlets in Java are server-side programs that handle client requests and return a customized or dynamic response for each request. Here are a few common and widely-used servlets in Java:

- HttpServlet: This is an abstract class provided by the Java Servlet API. It's extended to create HTTP servlets, i.e., servlets that use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

- GenericServlet: This is an abstract class provided by Java Servlet API that implements the Servlet, ServletConfig and Serializable interfaces. It's protocol-independent.

- DispatcherServlet: This servlet is part of Spring MVC framework. It works as the front controller to manage the flow of the Spring MVC application.

- FacesServlet: This servlet is part of the JavaServer Faces (JSF) framework. It works as the main controller that handles all the requests and responses in JSF.

- JspServlet: This servlet is part of the Java Servlet API and is used to process JSP pages in a web application.

- StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter: While not technically a servlet, this Filter servlet provided by the Struts2 framework works as a front controller for handling all requests in a Struts2 application.

7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)

Web servers are software systems that serve content or services to end users over the internet. In the context of Java and Spring Boot, there are several popular web servers (also known as application servers):

- Apache Tomcat: This is one of the most popular web servers in the Java ecosystem. It's lightweight, open-source, and is often used for serving Java web applications. It supports the Servlet, JSP, EL, and WebSocket APIs.
- Jetty: Jetty is another lightweight and flexible web server that's often used for smaller applications and microservices. It supports the Servlet API and WebSocket API, and can also be embedded in applications.
- JBoss/WildFly: JBoss is a full-featured, enterprise-grade application server that's now maintained under the name WildFly. It supports the full Java EE stack, including technologies like JSP, Servlet, and EJB.
- GlassFish: GlassFish is an open-source application server that provides a full Java EE platform. It was the reference implementation for Java EE, and it supports technologies like Servlet, JSP, EJB, JPA, and JSF.
- WebSphere: WebSphere is an enterprise-grade application server provided by IBM. It supports the full Java EE stack.
- WebLogic: WebLogic is another enterprise-grade application server, this one provided by Oracle. It also supports the full Java EE stack.
