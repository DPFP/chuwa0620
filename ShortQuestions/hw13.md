## Q2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Springboot?
```
Spring is a lightweight framework that offers an elaborate environment for robust programming and configuration model 
for Java-based applications. Spring Boot is a java-based framework that is best for creating stand-alone, Spring-based
 applications in a short period.
 
You can use it to create standalone applications
There is no need to deploy WAR files while using SpringBoot
It doesn't require XML configuration
Embeds Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow directly
Offers production-ready features
SpringBoot is easier to launch
Easier customization and management
```

## Q3. What is IOC and What is DI?
```
Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and
assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the
 components that make up the application
```

## Q4. What is  @CompnonentScan?
```
we use the @ComponentScan annotation along with the @Configuration annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned. 
```

## Q5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
```
<context:component-scan> in XML and @ComponentScan in annotation
```

## Q6. What is  @SpringbootApplication?
```
It is commonly used as the main entry point of a Spring Boot application.
```

## Q7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
```
XML configuration
annotation
ava-based configuration
ML and Java combination
Component Scanning
```

## Q8. What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
```
@Component: class name and lowercase first letter
@Bean: method name as a bean name.
```

## Q9. What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
```
@Component is a generic annotation used to mark a class as a Spring bean.
@Service is a specialization of @Component and is typically used to annotate classes that represent services
@Repository is a specialization of @Component and is used to annotate classes that represent data access objects (DAOs)
```

## Q10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
```
@Autowired type -> name
@Resource name -> type
@Inject
@Value
```

## Q11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
```
Setter injection
Constructor injection
Field injection

Constructor injection is better, it can have Testability, Explicit Dependencies, Deterministic Object Creation
```

## Q12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primary
```
@primary on bean
@Qualifier("name") on injection variable
```

## Q13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
```
While the BeanFactory provides basic functionality for managing and manipulating beans, often in a programmatic way, 
the ApplicationContext provides extra functionality like MessageSource, Access to resources, Event propagation to beans,
 Loading of multiple (hierarchical) contexts etc.
```

## Q14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
```
Singleton scpoe:
When a bean is a singleton, only one shared instance of the bean will be managed, and all requests for beans with an id
 or ids matching that bean definition will result in that one specific bean instance being returned by the Spring container.
 
The prototype scope:
The non-singleton, prototype scope of bean deployment results in the creation of a new bean instance every time a request
 for that specific bean is made (that is, it is injected into another bean or it is requested via a programmatic getBean()
  method call on the container). As a rule of thumb, you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful,
   while the singleton scope should be used for stateless bean
```

## Q15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean?
```
<bean 
  id="indexService" 
  class="com.baeldung.di.spring.IndexService" />
     
<bean 
  id="indexApp" 
  class="com.baeldung.di.spring.IndexApp" >
    <property name="service" ref="indexService" />
</bean>    
```
