# 2. Type the Comment feature for the class project.
Done. See details in /MavenProject/redbook_comment

# 4.  what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
JPA is a Java specification that provides a set of standard interfaces and annotations for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java applications.

Hibernate is an open-source, lightweight ORM framework that simplifies the process of mapping Java objects to relational database tables and vice versa.

# 5.  What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
HikariCP is a high-performance JDBC connection pool for Java applications.

Save steps of frequent creation and destroy of threads, and improve the efficiency.

Allows your application to handle a large number of clients concurrently without exhausting the database resources.

# 6.  What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
- @OneToMany:
Author to Books

- @ManyToOne:
PhoneNumbers to User

- @ManyToMany:
Students to Courses

# 7. What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
CascadeType.ALL means that all operations (including persist, merge, remove, refresh, and detach) performed on the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities.

orphanRemoval = true means that if an associated entity is removed from the relationship, it will be automatically removed from the database.

Other types of Cascade type include: 
- PERSIST:when the parent entity is persisted, the associated entities will also be persisted.

- REMOVE: when the parent entity is deleted from the database, the associated entities will also be removed.

- REFRESH: when the parent entity is refreshed from the database, the associated entities will also be refreshed.

- DETACH: when the parent entity is detached from the persistence context, the associated entities will also be detached.

# 8. What is the  fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
LAZY fetch means to extract info only when that certain info is requested. It fits to situations that data scale is large.

EAGER fetch means to extract info as soon as called. It fits to quick response and frequent request situation.

# 9.  What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?
We don't have to implement it as long as it fits the convention.
```
public List<Product> findByNameAndDescription(String name, String description)

public List<Post> findBySentDateBetween(String date)
```

# 14. What is JPQL?
JPQL is a query language used in Java applications to interact with databases through JPA. JPQL provides a way to perform database queries using Java classes and objects, rather than writing native SQL queries.

# 15. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
@NamedQuery is used to define a single named query associated with an entity class.

@NamedQueries is used to define multiple named queries associated with an entity class. It allows you to group multiple named queries together as an array.

# 16. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
@Query is an annotation provided by the Spring Data JPA framework. It is used to define custom queries using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL queries for data access. We write sql in entity layer.

# 17.  What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
Hibernate Query Language, is a query language provided by Hibernate, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java. 
Criteria Queries are an alternative approach to query data using Hibernate. Criteria Queries use a type-safe, object-oriented API to build queries programmatically.

# 18. What is EnityManager?
EntityManager is a core interface in JPA (Java Persistence API) used for managing the persistence of entities in a relational database. It is the main object responsible for interacting with the underlying database in a JPA-based application.

# 19. What is SessionFactory and Session?
SessionFactory is a heavyweight, thread-safe object that serves as a factory for creating Session objects.

Session is a lightweight, non-thread-safe object that represents a single unit of work with the database. It is used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities, execute queries, and manage transactions in Hibernate.

# 20. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are executed as a single unit of work. It follow ACID principles.

# 21. What is hibernate Caching?
- First-Level Cache (Session-Level Cache):
The first-level cache is enabled by default and is associated with a single Hibernate Session. It stores entities and their associated data that have been recently queried or persisted within the current Session. 
- Second-Level Cache:
The second-level cache is a shared cache that spans across multiple Session instances. It allows entities to be cached across different Session instances and even across different parts of the application.
- Query Cache:
The query cache is used to cache the results of database queries.

# 22. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
The first-level cache is local to a single Session, focuses on individual entity instances, and is not shareable among multiple Session instances. On the other hand, the second-level cache is shared across different Session instances, caches entire objects or query results, and is intended for broader performance optimization in a multi-session and multi-threaded environment.

# 24. Write a simple factory design pattern example.
