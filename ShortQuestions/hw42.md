### 4. what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
JPA is a Java specification that provides a standard way to map Java objects to relational database tables.

Hibernate is a powerful and widely used ORM framework for Java applications. It is an implementation of the JPA specification and provides additional features beyond the standard JPA functionalities.

### 5. What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
HikariCP (commonly referred to as Hikari) is a high-performance, lightweight, and extremely fast connection pooling library for Java applications. It is designed to efficiently manage database connections, which are typically one of the most expensive resources to acquire and release, especially in web applications.

### 6. What is the @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
@OneToMany: one entity (parent) can have multiple related entities (children), and each child can be associated with only one parent.

@ManyToOne: one entity (parent) can have one related entities (children), and each child can be associated with multiple parent.

@ManyToMany: one entity (parent) can have multiple related entities (children), and each child can be associated with multiple parent.

### 7. What is the cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
CascadeType.ALL is a convenience option that includes all cascade operations: persist, merge, remove, and refresh.

orphanRemoval = true means that if a ChildEntity is removed from the children collection of a ParentEntity, it will also be deleted from the database.

### 8. What is the fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
fetch = FetchType.LAZY: With FetchType.LAZY, related entities are loaded from the database only when they are explicitly accessed or requested. It means that the related entities are not fetched immediately when the main entity is loaded. Instead, they are loaded on-demand, typically when you access the related collection or association through getter methods.

fetch = FetchType.EAGER:
With FetchType.EAGER, related entities are loaded immediately and eagerly fetched along with the main entity. It means that when you retrieve the main entity from the database, the associated related entities are also fetched and loaded in the same query.

### 9.What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?

Entity Class Names:
Entity class names should be in camel-case and singular form.
The first letter of the class name should be capitalized.
Example: Student, Department, Order

Table Names:
Table names are usually in lowercase and plural form.
If the table name consists of multiple words, they are typically separated by underscores.
Example: students, departments, orders

Field Names:
Field names should be in camel-case.
The first letter of the field name should be in lowercase.
Example: firstName, lastName, age

### 14: What is JPQL?
JPQL stands for Java Persistence Query Language. It is a query language used in Java Persistence API (JPA) to perform database queries in an object-oriented way. JPQL allows you to write queries in terms of entity classes and their properties, rather than writing native SQL queries that directly interact with the database tables.

### 15: What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
@NamedQuery and @NamedQueries are annotations in Java Persistence API (JPA) that allow you to define named queries for your entity classes. Named queries are pre-defined queries written in JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL, and they can be referenced by their names in JPA operations.

### 16: What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
In Spring Data JPA, @Query is an annotation used to define custom queries directly in a Spring Data repository interface. It allows you to write SQL (native queries) or JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries and associate them with method signatures in the repository interface.

We write sql in entity layer.

### 17: What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
HQL (Hibernate Query Language):
HQL is a query language specific to Hibernate, and it closely resembles JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) used in JPA. HQL queries are written in terms of Hibernate entity classes and their properties, similar to writing SQL queries for the database tables.

Criteria Queries:
Criteria Queries, on the other hand, are a programmatic and type-safe way to build queries in Hibernate. Instead of writing queries as strings like HQL, Criteria Queries use a set of API methods to construct queries dynamically.

### 18: What is EnityManager?
It is a core interface in Java Persistence API (JPA) that is responsible for managing the persistence context in JPA-based applications. It acts as the primary interface between Java application code and the underlying database, allowing developers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entity objects, execute queries, and manage transactions.

### 19: What is SessionFactory and Session?
SessionFactory:
SessionFactory is an interface in Hibernate that is responsible for creating and managing Session instances. It is a factory for Session objects, and typically, there is one SessionFactory per application or database.

Session is an interface in Hibernate that represents a single unit of work with the database. It is used to perform database operations, such as persisting, retrieving, updating, and deleting entities. A Session instance is obtained from the SessionFactory.

### 20.What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
A transaction is a sequence of one or more operations performed on a database that must be executed as a single, indivisible unit of work. In the context of databases, a transaction must satisfy properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.

### 21.What is hibernate Caching?
Hibernate Caching is a mechanism used to improve the performance of database operations by reducing the number of interactions with the database. It is a critical feature of Hibernate, an ORM framework for Java applications, designed to minimize the overhead of repeatedly fetching data from the database.

### 22.What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
First level operates specific to a single hibernate session instance and second level is shared among multiple hibernate session instances
First level only has life time of single hibernate session and second level surive across multiple sessions.
