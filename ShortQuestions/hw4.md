### 1. What is generic in Java? and type the generic code by yourself.
Generics are a feature in Java that allows types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. When using the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) developed by others, generics make it possible for you to check for compile-time type safety.

In simpler terms, generics are like variables, but instead of representing values, they represent types. They are most commonly used in collection classes, like ArrayList and HashMap.

Practice code in MavenProject/generic.

### 2. Read those codes and type it one by one by yourself. the push the code to your branch.
