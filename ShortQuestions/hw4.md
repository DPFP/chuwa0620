1. Generic means parameterized types. Using generics, the idea is to allow any data type to be it Integer, String, or any user-defined Datatype and it is possible to create classes that work with different data types.

   A Generic class simply means that the tems or functions in that class can be generalized with the parameter(example T) to specify that we can add any type as a parameter in place of T like Integer, Character, String, Double or any other user-defined type.
