#### 1. Practice collection



#### 2. What is the checked exception and unchecked exception in Java, could you give one example?



#### 3. Can there be multiple finally blocks?

No



#### 4. When both catch and finally return values, what will be the final result ?



#### 5. What is Runtime/unchecked exception ? what is Compile/Checked Exception ?



#### 6. What is the difference between throw and throws ?



#### 7. Run the below three pieces codes, Noticed the printed exceptions. why do we put the Null/Runtime



#### 8. Why finally always be executed ?



#### 9. What are the types of design patterns in Java ?



#### 10. What are the SOLID Principles ?





#### 11. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java ?



#### 12. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) ?



#### 13. (SOLID-L)Liskovâ€™s substitution principle states that if class B is a subtype of class A, then object of type A may be substituted with any object of type B. What does this actually mean? (from OA ) choose your
answer.

1. It mean that if the object of type A can do something, the object of type B could also be able tp
  perform the same thing
2. It means that all the objects of type A could execute all the methods present in its subtype B
3. It means if a method is present in class A, it should also be present in class B so that the object of
  type B could substitute object of type A.
4. It means that for the class B to inherit class A, objects of type B and objects of type A must be same.
