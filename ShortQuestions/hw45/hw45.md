## 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

1. User accesses the application, server creates a session and sends back a cookie with the session ID.
   
2. Subsequent requests from the user's browser include the cookie with the session ID.

3. Server identifies the user based on the session ID and retrieves the session data.

4. Store user-specific information in the session

5.  On subsequent requests, retrieve and use user information from the session.
