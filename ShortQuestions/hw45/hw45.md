##2. What is the authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system before granting access to certain resources, data, or functionalities

---

## 3. What is the authorization?

Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources, functionalities, or information based on the authenticated identity and the associated permissions or privileges.

---

## 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

authentication focuses on verifying the identity of the user or entity, while authorization determines what actions or data the authenticated user is allowed to access. 

---

## 5. What is HTTP Session?

HTTP Session is a mechanism used in web development to maintain state and store information about a user's interactions with a web application across multiple HTTP requests

---

## 6. What is Cookie?

A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a user's web browser (client-side) and is stored on the user's device

--- 

## 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

- definition
    - Cookie: A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a user's web browser and is stored on the user's device.
    - Session: A session is a way of maintaining state and storing user-specific data on the server-side during a user's visit to a website
    
- Data Persistence
    - Cookie: Cookies can be persistent or session-based.
    - Session: Sessions typically last as long as the user's visit to the website.
    
- Purpose
    - Cookie: Cookies are mainly used to track user interactions and store user-specific information on the client-side.
    - Session: Sessions are used to maintain state and store user-specific data on the server-side during a user's visit. 
    
- Usage
    - Cookie: Cookies are more suitable for storing small amounts of non-sensitive data on the client-side. 
    - Session: Sessions are more suitable for storing larger amounts of sensitive data or data that should not be exposed to the client-side.

## 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

1. User accesses the application, server creates a session and sends back a cookie with the session ID.
   
2. Subsequent requests from the user's browser include the cookie with the session ID.

3. Server identifies the user based on the session ID and retrieves the session data.

4. Store user-specific information in the session

5.  On subsequent requests, retrieve and use user information from the session.

## 9. What is JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties in the form of a JSON object. 

---

## 10. What is the spring security filter?

Filters in Spring Security are responsible for intercepting and processing incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses to enforce security policies and provide authentication and authorization mechanisms.

---

## 11. decribe how do JWT work

encode data, and pass token where can be decoded with same mechanism.


---

## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

MD5 

---

## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?

UserDetailsService is an interface in Spring Security that provides a way to load user-specific data from a data source, such as a database or an LDAP directory.  

AuthenticationProvider is an interface that performs the actual authentication process in Spring Security  

AuthenticationManager is a central component that coordinates the authentication process in Spring Security.  

AuthenticationFilter is a specific type of filter in Spring Security that intercepts incoming HTTP requests and attempts to perform user authentication based on the provided credentials

---

## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

- not connected in distributed system, use redis

---

## 15. how to get value from application.properties?

write in application.properties and then use @Value

---

## 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

- The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is responsible for configuring how incoming HTTP requests are secured and authorized. This method allows you to define access rules, set up authentication mechanisms, and specify other security-related configurations.

- The configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method is used to define the mechanism for authenticating users in the application. This method allows you to specify how Spring Security should retrieve user details and how the authentication process should be performed.

---

## 17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, ensuring that they are who they claim to be.

- Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has the right permissions to perform certain actions or access specific resources within the application.
