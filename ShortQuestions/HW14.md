#### List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

#### What is the authentication?

Authentication 验证⽤户能否登录, who are you.

#### What is HTTP Session?

An HTTP session is *a temporary information exchange between a server and a client*. 

#### What is Cookie?

A cookie is **information that a website puts on a user's computer**. Cookies store limited information from a web browser session on a given website that can then be retrieved in the future.

#### What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

Cookies and sessions are used by websites to store users' data across different pages of the site. The key difference between sessions and cookies is that **sessions are saved on the server side while cookies are saved on the client side**. Cookies are small text files used to store user information on the user's computer.

#### How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

因此，可以说会话和Cookie一起工作，以在整个应用程序中保持用户信息。会话用于在服务器端存储信息，而Cookie用于在客户端和服务器之间传输唯一的会话标识符

- **会话（Session）**: 服务器上存储用户信息，并将与该会话相关联的唯一会话ID发送到客户端的Cookie中。当客户端与服务器通信时，它会发送这个Cookie，服务器则使用其中的会话ID来检索用户信息。
- **Cookie**: 也可以直接将用户信息或识别信息存储在客户端的Cookie中，但这种做法通常不如使用会话安全和灵活。

#### What is JWT?

JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is **a stateless method of securely transmitting information between parties as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object**. It is often used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and APIs.

#### What is the spring security filter?

Spring Security Filter 是 Spring Security 框架的一部分，用于在应用程序的请求和响应生命周期中执行安全性检查。它允许开发者在请求到达控制器之前，对其进行拦截和处理，如身份验证、授权、跨站请求伪造（CSRF）保护等。这种过滤机制确保了应用程序的安全性，只允许合适的用户访问受保护的资源。

#### Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

Yes. BCryptPasswordEncoder from Spring Security

#### What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)

1. **UserDetailService**: This is an interface used to retrieve user-related data. It is used by the Spring Security framework to handle user authentication. When a user tries to authenticate, this method returns user-related data such as username, password, and granted authorities.

1. **AuthenticationProvider**: This interface is used to process a specific type of authentication. Implementations must contain the logic to validate authentication requests of a specific type. For example, you might have one `AuthenticationProvider` to handle database authentication and another to handle LDAP authentication.
2. **AuthenticationManager**: This interface is responsible for passing requests through a chain of `AuthenticationProvider` instances. When a user tries to authenticate, the `AuthenticationManager` passes the authentication request to each provider in turn, until an `AuthenticationProvider` returns a fully populated `Authentication` object.
3. **AuthenticationFilter**: In Spring Security, filters are used to implement functionalities related to authentication and authorization. An `AuthenticationFilter` sits in the security filter chain and is responsible for handling authentication requests. It extracts credentials from the HTTP request (such as username and password), wraps them into an `Authentication` object, and passes that to the `AuthenticationManager` for validation.



#### What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

Session variables and cookies are synonymous. So if a user has set his browser not to accept any cookies, your Session variables won't work for that server

using JWT

#### how to get value from application.properties?

You can use the `@Value` annotation and access the property in whichever Spring bean you're using

#### What is the role of configure (HttpSecurity http) and configure (AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

1. **`configure(HttpSecurity http)`:** This method is used to configure how the application's HTTP security is handled. By providing an instance of `HttpSecurity`, you can specify security settings like which URLs require authentication, what type of authentication is required (e.g., form login, basic auth), authorization roles required for accessing certain endpoints, and other details related to the HTTP security. Here's an example of how this might be used:

   ```
   javaCopy code@Override
   protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
       http
           .authorizeRequests()
               .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
               .anyRequest().authenticated()
               .and()
           .formLogin();
   }
   ```

   This example configures Spring Security to require authentication for all requests, and only users with the "ADMIN" role can access URLs under "/admin/".

2. **`configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`:** This method is used to configure user authentication against various types of authentication providers (e.g., in-memory, JDBC, LDAP). You can specify where user details are loaded from, how passwords are encoded, and other details related to the authentication process. Here's an example of how this might be used:

   ```java
   javaCopy code@Override
   protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
       auth
           .inMemoryAuthentication()
               .withUser("user").password(passwordEncoder().encode("password")).roles("USER")
               .and()
               .withUser("admin").password(passwordEncoder().encode("admin")).roles("ADMIN");
   }
   ```

   This example sets up in-memory authentication with two users, each having different roles.

In summary, `configure(HttpSecurity http)` is responsible for HTTP-level security configurations, while `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` deals with authentication configurations, including user details and credentials management. Both are essential for setting up a comprehensive security configuration in a Spring application.

#### What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

Authentication 验证⽤户能否登录, who are you.
Authorization ⽤户有没有访问某个API的权限。can this user do this?
⽐如普通⽤户访问不了设定为admin的权限。
