Maven is a DevOps tool that can help build and develop the applications aotomatically.  
It is used to manage the project, like organize the code files, manage the dependency and build scripts to run the compiler tools.

Maven lifecycle means the tasks performed when the macen build commands are executed. There are three phases, including clean, default and site.  

For the clean phase, it is used to clean up the project and remove other compiled files. Otherewise, other phases cannot be initiated.  

For the default phase, it includes several steps. Validate whethere the project and all the files are correct. Compile and test the cource code. Package the compiled code. Integration-test is used to process and deploy the package. Verify the package. Install and deploy the package.  

For the site phase, it includes pre-site, site, post-site and site-deploy.

# 11
Package is used to package the compiled code in the distributable format. Install means that package is installed in the local repository.  

# 12
Maven is the framework for ta collection of maven plugins. Plugins can help to build tasks automatically, like compliation, packaging deployment and so on.  

spring-boot-maven-plugin: used for build and develop java web applications by using the spring boot framework.  
maven-deploy-plugin: used to upload the project artifacts to the internal remote repository.  
maven-jar-plugin: used to create a Java Archive (JAR) file from the compiled project classes and resources.
