#### 1. Practice collection



#### 2. What is the checked exception and unchecked exception in Java, could you give one example?

The checked exception is the one declared `throws`, so we have to do with the Exception. For unchecked one, we don't have to do Exception ourselves.

```java
public int checked(int[] a, int index) throws Exception {
    int res = 0;
    try {
        res = a[index];
    } catch (Exception e) {
        
    }
    return res;
}
public int unchecked(int[] a, int index) throws Exception {
    int res = a[index];
    return res;
}
```



#### 3. Can there be multiple finally blocks?

No, only one.



#### 4. When both catch and finally return values, what will be the final result ?

Yes, they could come in together, but the one in catch block is void. The return value will be the finally one.

#### 5. What is Runtime/unchecked exception ? what is Compile/Checked Exception ?

Runtime/unchecked exception could show up in Runtime. Compile/Checked Exception happens during Compiling.

#### 6. What is the difference between throw and throws ?

`throw` is used to manually throw an exception, while `throws` is used in method declarations to indicate that the method may throw one or more exceptions.

#### 7. Run the below three pieces codes, Noticed the printed exceptions. why do we put the Null/Runtime

1. In `b / a` , once a == 0, the program would crush. `ArithmeticException` comes first. 
2. The `NullPointerException` occurs when calling the `equals` method on a `null` object (`s.equals("aa")`).
3. Only the `RuntimeException` is thrown explicitly with `throw new RuntimeException()`.





#### 8. Why finally always be executed ?



#### 9. What are the types of design patterns in Java ?

Creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

#### 10. What are the SOLID Principles ?

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility or task.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension (to add new features) but closed for modification (to avoid altering existing code).
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use; interfaces should be small and specific to the clients' needs.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions to achieve loose coupling.



#### 11. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java ?

1. Eager Initialization:

   ```java
   public class Singleton {
       private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
   
       private Singleton() { }
   
       public static Singleton getInstance() {
           return instance;
       }
   }
   ```

   

2. Lazy Initialization:

   ```java
   public class Singleton {
       private volatile static Singleton instance;
   
       private Singleton() { }
   
       public static Singleton getInstance() {
           if (instance == null) {
               synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                   if (instance == null) {
                       instance = new Singleton();
                   }
               }
           }
           return instance;
       }
   }
   ```

   

#### 12. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) ?

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities should be designed in a way that allows for easy extension (adding new features) without modifying the existing code.

#### 13. (SOLID-L)Liskovâ€™s substitution principle states that if class B is a subtype of class A, then object of type A may be substituted with any object of type B. What does this actually mean? (from OA ) choose your
4. It means that if the object of type A can do something, the object of type B could also be able to perform the same thing.
