## 1. Explain volatile variables in java? (we also use it in Singleton)

a variable declared volatile means any read or write to it will directly affect main memory and update in all thread

---

## 2. how to create a new thread(Please also consider Thread Pool case)?

1. Thread creation:
    - implements Callable<T>
    - implements Runnable
    - extends Thread
2. Thread Pool creation
    - create thread pool: ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
        - FixedThreadPool (fix pool)
        - CachedThreadPool (dynamic pool)
        - SingleThreadExecutor (single thread pool)
 
---

## 3.  Difference between Runnable and Callable

- runnable does not return a result while callable can

---

## 4.  what is the diff between t.start() and t.run()?

- t.start starts a new thread to execute the task(run())
- t.run() excute the task in the current thread.

---

## 5. Which way of creating threads is better: Thread class or Runnable interface?

Runnable is better because 
- runnable is interface which we can implement multiple interface in java while thread is not.
- ExcutorService and ThreadPoolExecutor work better with runnable class

---

## 6. what is the thread status?
- New
- Runnable
- Running
- Blocked/Waiting
- Timed Waiting
- Terminated

---

## 7. difference between wait() and sleep() method
- wait() is used with synchronization and require lock release while sleep() does not
- wait() waits until notified or interrupted while sleep() stop execution for a time duration

---

## 8. What is deadlock?

when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release the lock.

---

## 9. how do threads communicate with each other?

we could use multiple methods like:
- wait
- notify
- synchronized
- join
- interrupt
- ThreadLocal

---

## 10. what is join() method?

t.join() will let current thread to wait until thread t finish.

---

## 11. what is yield() method

The yield() method provides an opportunity for the other thread to run.

---

## 12. Explain thread pool

a collection of thread can be used to execute multiple tasks concurrently.

## 13. What is Executor Framework in Java, its different types and how to create these executors?

For managing and executing tasks concurrently.

- Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads): fixed task
- Executors.newCachedThreadPool(): dynatic task
- Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(): single worker thread
- Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize): this can create a thread pool which can schedule tasks to be executed periodically or after a delay

---

## 14. Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor

- shutdown() allow previous tasks to finish, but prevent the executor to accept new tasks
- shutdownNow() stop the running tasks and pending tasks, and prevent the executor to accept new tasks

---

## 15. What is Atomic classes? when do we use it?

Atomic class is classes who support concurrent programming with thread-safe operations on shared variables. we use when multiple threads need read and write a shared variable concurrently.

---

## 16. What is the concurrent collections?

Same as atomic class, common concurrent collections:

- ConcurrentHashMap
- ConcurrentLinkedQueue
- ConcurrentSkipListMap
- CopyOnWriteArrayList

---

## 17. what kind of locks you know?

- ReentrantLock: a thread can acquire the lock multiple times without deadlock.
- ReadWriteLock: consists of two locks: read&write lock. if no threads hold write lock, multiple threads can acquire read lock, but only one thread can acquire the write lock.
- StampedLock: read, write, and optimistic read. It provides an optimistic read mode where multiple threads can read concurrently without acquiring the lock. If a thread wants to perform a write operation, it needs to acquire a write lock, which excludes other read and write operations.
- ReentrantReadWriteLock: allowing a thread that already holds the read lock to acquire it again. This type of lock can be useful when there are frequent read operations and rare write operations.

---

## 18. What is the difference between class lock and object lock?

- The class lock ensures that only one thread at a time can execute synchronized static methods or access static synchronized blocks in that class. It provides exclusive access to class-level resources shared among all instances of the class.
- The object lock ensures that only one thread at a time can execute synchronized instance methods or access synchronized instance blocks on that specific object. It provides exclusive access to instance-level resources of the object.

---

## 19. What is future and completableFuture?

- A Future object can be used to check if the computation is complete, retrieve the result when it becomes available, or cancel the computation.
- Based on future object, completableFuture provides a fluent and functional programming style, enabling the use of callbacks, transformations, and error handling



---

## 20. what is ThreadLocal?

- A thread-local variable is a variable that is accessible only within the context of a specific thread. Each thread accessing the variable has its own independently initialized copy of the variable.
