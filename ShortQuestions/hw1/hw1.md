# HW1

## Q1
This answer is in [README.md](./README.md).<br>

## Q2
`git rebase main`: turn parallel operations into sequential <br>
`git checkout main^`: checkout to the previous commit <br>
`git checkout HEAD~4`: checkout to the 4-th previous commit <br>
`git branch -f main HEAD~3`: moves (by force) the main branch to three parents behind HEAD. <br>
`git reset`: reverses changes by moving a branch reference backward in time to an older commit. <br>
`git cherry-pick branchName1 branchName2` <br>
`git fetch`: fetch data from a remote repository <br>
`git pull`: the workflow of fetching remote changes and then merging them <br>

### Q3: What is the basic steps to init a git repo in you local?
1. `cd` to target repo <br>
2. `git init` to create .git directory <br>

### Q4: How to clone a repo from Github?
`git clone URL`, where URL is provided by Github.

### Q5: How to create a new branch and checkout to that branch?
`git checkout -b newBranchName`

### Q6: How to merge the branch_test to master branch in command ? show me the commands
```
git checkout master
git merge branch_test
git push origin master
```

### Q7: How to stash your new code before leaving branch branch_learn_stash and pop your stash when you checkout back to branch_learn_stash? try commands way and IntelliJ way.
1. Commands way
   ```
   git stash
   git checkout anotherBranchName
   git checkout branch_learn_stash
   git stash pop
   ```
2. IntelliJ way
   Git-VCS Operations -> Stash Changes -> change branch and change back -> apply stash in local change tab

### Q8. How do you understand PR is based on Branch?
PR stands for Pull Request. This is a feature that allows developers to propose changes to a codebase. <br>
1. **Branch Creation**: When a developer wants to work on a new feature or fix a bug, they would typically create a new branch from the main or "master" branch (or whatever the current base branch is). This is done to isolate the changes for this specific feature or bug fix.

2. **Making Changes**: The developer makes their changes in this new branch. These changes could include adding new code, modifying existing code, or removing code. Each set of changes is typically committed with a descriptive message explaining what was done and why.

3. **Pull Request Creation**: Once the developer is satisfied with their changes, they can create a Pull Request (PR). This is a proposal to merge their changes back into the main branch.

4. **Review and Approval**: The PR is reviewed by other members of the team. They can comment on the changes, ask for clarifications, suggest modifications, or approve the changes.

5. **Merging**: Once the PR is approved, it can be merged back into the main branch. At this point, the changes that were made in the new branch are now part of the main branch.


### Q9. What is maven's role? what it be used to do?
Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on the project object model (POM) which is used for Java projects. <br>
The main roles of Maven include:
1. **Build Automation**: Like Make or Ant but much more powerful, Maven can compile source code, run tests, package the compiled code into a JAR or WAR file, and install the packaged code into a local or remote repository.
2. **Dependency Management**: Maven automatically handles the project's dependencies. It can download dependencies from the Maven Central Repository and store them in a local cache. It also checks for updates and transitive dependencies.
3. **Project Consistency**: Maven provides conventions for building projects, promoting consistency across projects. These conventions include a standard project structure, standard project stages (clean, compile, test, package, install, deploy), and standard naming conventions.
4. **Project Information Management**: Maven can generate a website or a PDF containing information about the project, such as team members, mailing list, dependency list, unit test reports, etc.

### Q10. What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details?
Maven has three built-in lifecycles: default (main lifecycle), clean, and site. Each lifecycle is composed of multiple phases.<br>
1. Default: concerned with building and deploying the project. 
2. Clean: cleaning the project and removing all files generated by the previous build.
3. Site: generates a site for the project.

### Q11. What is the difference between package and install in the Maven lifecycle?
1. **package**: This phase takes the compiled code and packages it into its distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file. After the package phase has been executed, you should have a distributable artifact in your target directory.
2. **install**: This phase takes the package created in the package phase and installs it into your local Maven repository (typically a .m2 directory in your home directory). This makes the packaged artifact available to be used as a dependency in other projects on your local machine.

### Q12. What are plugins in Maven, list some plugins.
In Maven, a plugin is a collection of goals (tasks) that can be executed. Plugins are generally used to provide common build functionalities and are the primary means of extending Maven's functionality. Every task performed in Maven is done by plugins, including compiling code, running tests, creating JAR files, creating project documentation, and many more.
Maven has two types of plugins:

1. Build Plugins: They execute during the build and should be configured in the <build> element of the POM (Project Object Model).
2. Reporting Plugins: They execute during the site generation and should be configured in the <reporting> element of the POM.

Here are some commonly used Maven plugins:

- maven-compiler-plugin: It's used during the compile and test-compile phases to compile the project sources.

- maven-install-plugin: This plugin is used during the install phase to add artifact(s) to the local repository.

- maven-deploy-plugin: It's used in the deploy phase to copy the final package to the remote repository.

- maven-site-plugin: This plugin generates a website or a report for your project.

- maven-clean-plugin: It's used in the clean phase to clean the project and remove all files generated by the previous build.
