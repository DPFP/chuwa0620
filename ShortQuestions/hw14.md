2. **Selenium**: Selenium is an open-source framework used for automating web applications' testing. It provides a way to interact with web browsers, simulate user actions, and perform functional and regression testing.

3. **Cucumber**: Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It allows writing test scenarios in plain text using Gherkin language and then automating these scenarios using step definitions.

4. **JMeter**: Apache JMeter is an open-source tool used for performance and load testing of applications. It simulates a heavy load on a server, network, or object to test its strength and performance.

5. **Lifecycle of JUnit**: The lifecycle of JUnit includes `@BeforeAll`, `@BeforeEach`, `@Test`, `@AfterEach`, and `@AfterAll` annotations. They control the setup, execution, and teardown of test methods.

6. **@BeforeAll Method**: Yes, the `@BeforeAll` method should be at the class level (static) since it is executed before any instance of the class is created.

7. **Mockito**: Mockito is a mocking framework for Java that allows creating mock objects for testing. Its limitations include difficulty in mocking final classes/methods, lack of support for private methods, and potential overuse of mocking.

8. **@Mock and @InjectMocks**: `@Mock` is used to create a mock object, while `@InjectMocks` is used to inject the mocks into the tested object.

9. **Stubbing**: Stubbing refers to defining behaviors for mock objects, i.e., specifying what methods should return when they are called.

10. **Mockito ArgumentMatchers**: ArgumentMatchers help in matching arguments when stubbing/mock interactions.

11. **Hamcrest Matchers**: Hamcrest Matchers provide more readable and flexible assertions in testing.

12. **@Spy**: `@Spy` is used to create a partial mock, where certain methods of the real object are called unless stubbed.

13. **Difference between @Spy and @Mock**: `@Spy` invokes real methods unless stubbed, while `@Mock` creates a complete mock.

14. **Assertion**: Assertion is a way to validate that an actual result matches the expected result in a test case.

15. **Types of Tests for a New Feature**: Types of tests include unit tests (testing individual components), integration tests (testing interactions between components), and end-to-end tests (testing the entire system). Each type has its purpose in ensuring the quality of the feature.
