1. Done  
2. What is MVC pattern?  
   MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it is a software architectural pattern commonly used in the design of web applications.  
3. What is Front-Controller?  
   Front Controller is a design pattern used in web application development to centralize the handling of incoming requests from clients.  
4. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.  
   The `DispatcherServlet` is a central component in the Spring MVC framework, and it plays a crucial role in handling incoming HTTP requests and managing the flow of a Spring-based web application. It acts as the front controller for the application, responsible for routing requests to appropriate handlers (controllers) and processing them.  
5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ
   JSP is a view technology used to create dynamic web pages, and ModelAndView is a Spring-specific class used to pass data from the controller to the view in Spring MVC applications.  
6. Could you please google any other servlets  
   Thymeleaf, Freemarker, Velocity  
7. Other web servers.  
   Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services, Apache HTTP Server

2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benefits of using Srpingboot?  
   Spring is a powerful framework for building Java applications, while Spring Boot builds on top of Spring to simplify and accelerate the process of creating production-ready applications. The benefits of using Spring Boot include rapid development, auto-configuration, production-ready defaults, and an integrated development experience, making it a popular choice for modern Java development.  
3. What is IOC and What is DI?  
   Inversion of Control (IOC) is a design principle that shifts control of object creation and dependency management to an external framework, while Dependency Injection (DI) is a specific implementation of IOC that provides a way to inject dependencies into a class rather than having the class create its own dependencies.  
4. What is  `@CompnonentScan`?  
   Using `@ComponentScan` simplifies the configuration of Spring applications by reducing the need for explicit bean declarations and allowing Spring to automatically detect and manage the components in your application.  
5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?  
   In XML-based configuration, you use the <context:component-scan> element to enable component scanning and specify the base package(s) to be scanned.  
   In annotation-based configuration, you can use the @ComponentScan annotation to achieve the same result.  
6. What is  `@SpringbootApplication`?  
   This single annotation replaces the need to use separate `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations, making the application startup code concise and more readable.  
7. How many ways wo can define a bean?  
   1. XML Configuration: Define beans in an XML file using the <bean> element.
   2. Annotation-based Configuration: Use annotations like @Component, @Service, etc., to mark classes as beans.
   3. Java Configuration: Define beans as methods in @Configuration classes using @Bean annotation.
   4. Component Scanning: Use stereotype annotations and component scanning (@ComponentScan) to automatically register beans.
   5. Factory Method: Define beans using factory methods in @Configuration classes.
   6. Constructor Injection: Define beans with constructor arguments in XML or Java configuration.
   7. Setter Injection: Define beans with property values using XML or @Value annotation.
   8. Bean Definition Inheritance: Inherit bean configuration from existing beans.
   9. BeanPostProcessor: Implement BeanPostProcessor to customize bean instantiation and configuration.  
8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?  
    In Spring, the default bean names for `@Component` and `@Bean` are generated based on the name of the class or method, respectively. If the class name or method name starts with a lowercase letter, the default bean name will be the same as the class name or method name. If the class name or method name starts with an uppercase letter, the first letter of the name will be converted to lowercase to form the default bean name.  
9. What is the difference between @component and @service, @repository?  
   We can use @Component for general-purpose beans, @Service for service layer components, and @Repository for data access components. However, the decision to use one over the other is mostly based on semantic clarity and project organization rather than functional differences.  
10. How many annotations we can use to inject the bean?  
    1. `@Autowired`: This is the most commonly used annotation for dependency injection. It automatically wires the bean by type. If multiple beans of the same type exist, you can use @Qualifier to specify which one to inject.
    2. `@Resource`: This annotation allows you to inject beans by name. It can be used to inject beans by their names declared in the Spring container.
    3. `@Inject`: Similar to @Autowired, this annotation also performs dependency injection by type. It is part of the Java Dependency Injection (JSR-330) specification.
    4. `@Value`: Used for injecting simple values (primitives, strings, etc.) from properties files or directly as literals.
    5. `@Qualifier`: Used in conjunction with @Autowired or @Inject when there are multiple beans of the same type, and you want to specify the exact bean to be injected.
    6. `@Primary`: Used to mark a bean as the primary candidate for autowiring when multiple beans of the same type exist.  
11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
    in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
    Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, Field Injection.  
    Constructor injection is generally considered the best practice for dependency injection because of Immutability, Explicit Dependencies, Testability, Avoids Circular Dependencies, Encourages Design by Contract.  
12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
    the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primary.  
    By using @Primary or @Qualifier, we can manage the injection of multiple beans of the same type effectively, either by setting a primary candidate or by explicitly specifying the bean name to be injected.  
13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?  
    `BeanFactory` provides the basic functionality for managing beans in a Spring application. It is suitable for applications with limited resource requirements and where advanced features are not needed. On the other hand, ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory and provides a more feature-rich and powerful container that is suitable for most real-world applications. It offers additional features and capabilities, including support for internationalization, event handling, resource management, and more, making it the preferred choice in most Spring applications.  
14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.  
    1. Singleton  
    2. Prototype  
    3. Request  
    4. Session  
    5. GlobalSession  
    6. Application  
    7. WebSocket  
15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
    configure the bean?  
    In XML-based configuration, you can define a bean and its parameters or dependencies using the `<bean`> element. To configure the bean with its dependencies, you can use the `ref` attribute to reference other beans, and the `value` attribute to provide literal values for constructor arguments or properties.
