## Q1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
```
See details in the updated file.
```

## Q2.  what is the @configuration and @bean?
```
@Configuration: Make a class configuration by itself and will have methods to instantiate and configure the dependencies.

@Bean: When Spring finds an @Bean annotation, it executes that method and registers the return value as a bean within the ApplicationContext.
```

## Q3.  How do you handle the exception in Spring?
```
Using @ExceptionHandler:
This is used to specify which exceptions they handle in a controller method

Here is an example:
@Controller
public class Controller {
    @RequestMapping("/url")
    public String handleRequest() {
        return "name";
    }
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public String handleException(Exception e, HttpServletRequest request) {
        return "error-name";
    }
}
```

## Q4.  How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotaitons you know
```
Bean Validation API
Validation annotations:
@NotNull: to say that a field must not be null.
@NotEmpty: to say that a list field must not empty.
@NotBlank: to say that a string field must not be the empty string (i.e. it must have at least one character).
@Min and @Max: to say that a numerical field is only valid when it’s value is above or below a certain value.
@Pattern: to say that a string field is only valid when it matches a certain regular expression.
@Email: to say that a string field must be a valid email address.

Example:
class Customer {

  @Email
  private String email;

  @NotBlank
  private String name;
  
  // ...
}

Validated annotation:

Example:
@Service
@Validated
class ValidatingService{

    void validateInput(@Valid Input input){
      // do something
    }

}
```

## Q5.  What is the actuator?
```
Actuator is mainly used to expose operational information about the running application — health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc.
It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
```
