## Q2 What is the authentication?
It's the process of verifying someone's identity to ensure they are who they claim to be.
## Q3 What is the authorization?
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on a user's authenticated identity.
## Q4 What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
Authentication deals with confirming the user's identity, while authorization deals with what actions or operations the authenticated user is permitted to perform.
## Q5 What is HTTP Session?
HTTP Session is a mechanism that allows a web server to maintain stateful information about a user's interactions with a web application across multiple requests and responses.
## Q6 What is Cookie? 
Cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side(usually in the user's web browser) by a web server. It is used to track and remember user-specific information during their interactions with a website or web application.
## Q7 What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Session is a server-side mechanism for storing user-specific data throughout a user's interaction with a web application, while Cookie is a client-side data storage mechanism used to store small pieces of data sent by the server and included in subsequent HTTP requests.
## Q8 How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
We use sessions on the server-side to store user-specific data throughout the user's visit, and cookies on the client-side to store a unique session identifier. The server retrieves the session data using the session identifier stored in the cookie to maintain user information across the application.
## Q9 What is JWT?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact and self-contained way of representing information between parties as a JSON object. JWT is commonly used for authentication and data exchange in web applications.
## Q10 What is the spring security filter?
Spring Security filter is a part of the Spring Security framework that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses to enforce security and access control rules in a web application.
## Q11 decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
JWT works by encoding user information into a compact and digitally signed token. This token is sent in the HTTP Authorization header or as a parameter in API requests. The server validates the token's signature and extracts user data, enabling stateless and secure authentication and data exchange between parties.
## Q12 Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2
## Q13 What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)

1. UserDetailService: UserDetailsService is an interface provided by Spring Security that loads user-specific data, such as username, password, and authorities, from a data source (e.g., database). It is used during the authentication process to retrieve user details for validation.

2. AuthenticationProvider: AuthenticationProvider is responsible for authenticating users based on their credentials (e.g., username and password). It takes an Authentication object, containing user-provided credentials, and verifies them against the user details loaded from UserDetailsService. If successful, it creates a fully authenticated Authentication object.

3. AuthenticationManager: AuthenticationManager is the central component of the authentication process in Spring Security. It delegates the authentication request to one or more AuthenticationProviders. Each provider attempts to authenticate the user, and if successful, the AuthenticationManager returns a fully authenticated Authentication object.

4. AuthenticationFilter is a part of the Spring Security filter chain. It intercepts incoming HTTP requests and checks if the request contains authentication information (e.g., JWT or username-password). If present, it attempts to authenticate the user using the configured AuthenticationManager. If successful, it sets the user's security context, allowing access to protected resources.

## Q14 What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Sessions can consume server memory, especially when handling a large number of users, potentially leading to scalability issues.

Overcome the disadvantage: Set an appropriate session timeout to release server resources after a period of inactivity. Shorter timeouts can help free up resources quickly, but too short a timeout may inconvenience users.

## Q15 how to get value from application.properties?
We can use the Spring Boot Environment object or @Value annotation to access and retrieve the property values defined in the configuration file.

## Q16 What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
configure(HttpSecurity) method is used to define security rules for HTTP requests, while configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) is used to configure the authentication mechanism used by Spring Security to verify user credentials.

## Q17 What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
Spring Security authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, typically through username-password validation or token-based mechanisms. Authorization, on the other hand, involves determining what actions or resources the authenticated user is allowed to access within a web application.
