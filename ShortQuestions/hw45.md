### 2 What is the authentication?
Authentication is the process of identifying a user to provide access to a system.  

### 3 What is the authorization?
Authorization is the process of giving permission to access the resources.

### 4 What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
In authentication, the user or client and server are verified. Authentication determines whether the person is user or not.
In authorization, it is verified that if the user is allowed through the defined policies and rules. While it determines What permission do user have?

### 5 What is HTTP Session?
HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.

### 6 What is Cookie?
Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience.

### 7 What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information. Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user. It can only store a certain amount of info.  
Sessions are server-side files that contain user data. When the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed, the session is over. It can hold an indefinite quantity of data.

### 8 How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
The session cookie is a server-specific cookie that cannot be passed to any machine other than the one that generated the cookie. The server creates a “session ID” which is a randomly generated number that temporarily stores the session cookie. This cookie stores information such as the user’s input and tracks the movements of the user within the website. There is no other information stored in the session cookie. 

### 9 What is JWT?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

### 10 What is the spring security filter?
The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it. The following picture shows the dispatch happening based on matching the request path ( /foo/** matches before /** ). This is very common but not the only way to match a request.

### 11 decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
- Client: Sends POST request with username and password to Server
- Server: Validate credentials and generate JWT using a secret key and send JWT back to Client
- Client: Sends GET request with JWT in the header instead of session id
- Server: Validate JWT using the secret key and return responses to the client

### 12 Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
PasswordEncoder interface, implemented by BCryptPasswordEncoder to encoder our password.

### 13 What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
- UserDetialService: an interface provided by Spring Security, can be implemented by overriding loadUserByUsername(), which aims to retrieve the user data from the database using DAO
- AuthenticationProvider: defines how the JWT tokens can be generated, parsed, and validated
- AuthenticationManager: parse first time incoming request with username and password and generate JWT as response for the first time.
- AuthenticationFilter: parse incoming request with JWT and perform JWT validation using the AuthenticationProvider

### 14 What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Since data in session state is stored in server memory, it is not advisable to use session state when working with large sum of data. Session state variable stays in memory until you destroy it, so too many variables in the memory effect performance.  
Instead of storing the user reference ID on server side, we can give the user a token which already have all the related credentials and context encrypted into the token value, that way we don't need to use session id to store the user reference information.

### 15 how to get value from application.properties?
```
@Value("${my.property}")
private String myProperty;
```

### 16 What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
configure(HttpSecurity) allows configuration of web based security at a resource level, based on a selection match.  
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder) is used to establish an authentication mechanism by allowing AuthenticationProviders to be added easily.

### 17 What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
Authentication is the process of knowing and identifying the user that wants to access.  
Authorization is the process to allow authority to perform actions in the application.
