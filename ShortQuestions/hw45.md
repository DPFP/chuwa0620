# 2.  What is the authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system to ensure that they are who they claim to be. 

# 3.  What is the authorization?
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources, functionalities, or data based on the authenticated identity of a user, device, or system.

# 4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
The main purpose of authentication is to confirm the identity of an entity trying to access a system or resource.

The main purpose of authorization is to determine what actions an authenticated entity is allowed to perform and what information they can access.

Authentication involves presenting credentials, such as usernames, passwords, biometric data, or tokens, to prove one's identity.

Authorization involves evaluating the permissions and privileges associated with the authenticated identity to control their access to resources.

# 5.  What is HTTP Session?
An HTTP session is a mechanism used to maintain stateful communication between a web server and a web client (usually a web browser) over the stateless HTTP protocol.

# 6.  What is Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a web browser when a user visits a website. The browser stores this data locally, and for subsequent visits to the same website, the browser sends the cookie back to the server along with each request. Cookies are commonly used to track and remember information about the user and their interactions with the website.

# 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Session data is stored on the server-side. Cookies store data on the client-side (in the user's browser). 

Sessions have a limited scope and typically expire after a certain period of inactivity or when the user closes their browser. Cookies can have different scopes and expiration times.

# 8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application
When a user visits the website or logs in, the server creates a new session for that user. A unique session ID is generated and associated with the user's session data, which is stored on the server-side. 

The server sends the session ID to the client's browser as a cookie. The browser stores the session ID cookie locally and automatically includes it in subsequent requests to the same website.

The server uses the session ID from the cookie to identify the user's session data.

# 9.  What is JWT?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a way to represent and transmit information between two parties in the form of a JSON object. JWTs are often used as a means of authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs. A JWT is composed of three parts, header, payload and signature.

# 10. What is the spring security filter?
Spring Security is a widely used framework for handling security concerns in Java-based web applications. It provides a set of features and components to implement authentication, authorization, and other security-related functionalities.

# 11. decribe how do JWT work
Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client as part of the response. The client typically receives the token and stores it securely, such as in memory or local storage. For subsequent requests to protected resources or API endpoints, the client includes the JWT in the request header, ensuring it's sent along with every request.When the server receives a request with a JWT, it validates the token's signature to ensure it hasn't been tampered with or altered. The server also checks the token's expiration time to determine if the token is still valid. Expired tokens are rejected. If the JWT's signature is valid, and the token has not expired, the server extracts the user's identity and other claims from the token's payload.
Based on the user's identity and claims, the server can perform authentication and authorization

# 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
BCryptPasswordEncoder

# 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?
UserDetailsService is an interface provided by Spring Security that is used to load user-specific data when authenticating a user.

An AuthenticationProvider is responsible for authenticating users based on their credentials. It takes the user's submitted credentials and validates them against the stored credentials from the UserDetailsService. If the authentication is successful, it returns a fully authenticated Authentication object; otherwise, it throws an AuthenticationException.

The AuthenticationManager is responsible for managing and coordinating the authentication process. 

# 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Problem: Sessions are typically stored on the server-side, and each active session consumes server resources.

Resolution: Consider using stateless authentication mechanisms like JSON Web Tokens. These mechanisms store user authentication information on the client-side and do not require server-side sessions.

# 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is responsible for configuring the security rules that determine which URLs are secured, how authentication is performed, and what level of authorization is required to access different parts of the application.

The configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method is used to configure the authentication mechanism and provide information about how Spring Security should authenticate users.

# 17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity trying to access a system or application. Spring Security supports various authentication mechanisms, including: Form-based authentication, JSON web tokens.

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has permission to access certain resources or perform specific actions within the application. In Spring Security, authorization is typically based on user roles and authorities. A user's role determines what they are allowed to do within the application. Spring Security allows developers to define authorization rules using expressions or configurations in the configure(HttpSecurity http) method of the security configuration class.
