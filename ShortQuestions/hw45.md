Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity trying to access a system or resource. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be. In authentication, the system confirms the identity of the user by asking for credentials, such as a username and password, biometric data (fingerprint, face, etc.), or digital certificates.

## 3
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or functionalities based on a user's authenticated identity and their assigned privileges or permissions. It is the next step after authentication.

## 4
In conclusion, authentication focuses on verifying the identity of a user, while authorization focuses on controlling what the user is allowed to do once their identity is confirmed.

HTTP Session is a mechanism in web development used to maintain state and store user-specific information between multiple HTTP requests and responses. It allows web applications to recognize and associate subsequent requests from the same user or client with their previous interactions.

## 6
A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side (user's browser) that is sent back to the server with each subsequent request from the same client.
Cookies are set by the server and sent to the client as part of the response headers. The client stores the cookies and includes them in subsequent requests as part of the request headers.
Cookies can be used to store simple pieces of information, such as user preferences or tracking data, and are often used to maintain state between the client and the server.

## 7
Sessions are used to maintain state and store user-specific data on the server-side, while cookies are used to store small pieces of data on the client-side and are sent back to the server with each request. Sessions are more secure for sensitive data since the data is stored on the server and not accessible to the client, while cookies are suitable for lightweight client-side state management and simple data storage. Often, sessions use cookies to store the session ID, but cookies can also be used for other purposes beyond session management.

## 8
When a user logs in or interacts with the application, a session is created on the server to store user-specific data, such as preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication status. The server generates a unique session ID and sends it back to the client's browser as a cookie. Subsequent requests from the client include the session ID cookie, allowing the server to identify the user and retrieve the associated data from the session store. This enables the application to deliver personalized content and services based on the user's identity and preferences. Sessions have an expiration time, ensuring that inactive sessions are eventually removed to free up server resources. 

## 9
JWT stands for "JSON Web Token," and it is a compact and self-contained way of representing information between parties in the form of a JSON object. JWTs are used as a means of securely transmitting information between two parties, often as a mechanism for authentication and authorization in web applications.

## 10
Spring Security leverages these servlet filters to implement security-related functionalities in web applications. These filters are arranged in a chain, known as the filter chain, through which incoming requests pass before reaching the actual servlet that handles the request.

In a Spring Security-enabled application, when an HTTP request is received, it goes through the filter chain. Each filter in the chain performs its specific task, and the request can be modified, authenticated, authorized, or rejected based on the configuration and the filters' behavior. If the request successfully passes through the entire filter chain, it reaches the actual servlet responsible for processing the request and generating the response.

## 11
* client post /authenticate with username and password
* server validate the info and generate the JWT using secret key
* server return the JWT token
* client get with JWT in the header
* server validate the JWT using the secret
* server return the response

## 12
Yes, we do not store password directly in the db.

## 13
The UserDetailsService interface is a core part of Spring Security and is used to retrieve user details during the authentication process. It is an abstraction that provides a way to load user-specific data, such as username, password, authorities (roles), and other user-related attributes, from a data source (e.g., database, LDAP, custom service) to perform authentication and authorization.

The AuthenticationProvider interface is responsible for authenticating users based on the provided credentials and returning a fully populated Authentication object if successful. It supports multiple authentication mechanisms and allows you to plug in different authentication strategies.

The AuthenticationManager interface is the central component that orchestrates the authentication process. It receives an Authentication object, which contains the user's credentials, and attempts to authenticate the user by delegating the authentication process to the configured AuthenticationProviders.

The AuthenticationFilter processes login attempts and extracts user credentials from incoming requests. 

## 14
Server-Side Storage: Sessions require server-side storage to store session data associated with each user. This can consume server resources, especially when handling a large number of concurrent users, potentially impacting application performance and scalability.

Sol: Limit Session Data and Set Session Timeout.

Session may not be shared across different servers.

Sol: use JWT or redis shared cache.

These methods are used to configure the security settings for your web application, including authentication and authorization rules.

configure(HttpSecurity http):
This method is used to configure the security settings related to HTTP requests and access control. It allows you to define rules for which URLs are accessible and what level of authentication and authorization is required for each URL.

configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth):
This method is used to configure how Spring Security performs authentication. You can use this method to define how users are authenticated, such as using in-memory authentication, JDBC authentication, or custom authentication providers.

## 17
By combining authentication and authorization, Spring Security ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources and perform actions, providing a secure and controlled environment for web applications. It allows developers to focus on the application's business logic while leaving the security concerns to the framework.
