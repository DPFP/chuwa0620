# HW 13
## Q2. What is the authentication?
```
The process of verifying someone's identity.
```

## Q3. What is the authorization?
```
the process of determining what permissions an already authenticated user has.
```

## Q4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
```
One deal with the identity and one deal with the permission of identified user.
```

## Q5. What is HTTP Session?
```
A feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response 
interactions between a client application and a Web application.
```

## Q6. What is Cookie?
```
A piece of data that is used to track and remember user-specific information during their interactions with a website or web application.
```

## Q7.  What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
```
One is stored in the server and one is stored on the user's end.
```

## Q8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
```
The server retrieves the session data using the session identifier stored in the cookie to maintain user information across the application.
```

## Q9. What is JWT?
```
JSON Web Token, it is an open standard that defines a compact, self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
```

## Q10. What is the spring security filter?
```
Spring Security filter is a part of the Spring Security framework that is a chain of Spring-managed beans that are applied to incoming HTTP requests to implement security controls.
```

## Q11. decribe how do JWT work
```
First, encoding user information into a compact and digitally signed token. The server validates the token's signature and extracts user data, enabling stateless and secure authentication and data exchange.
```

## Q12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
```
Yes, it's safer and easier and examples: bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2
```

## Q13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?
```
-UserDetailService: an interface provided by Spring Security that loads user-specific data, such as username, password, and authorities, from a data source. It is used during the authentication process.

-AuthenticationProvider: It authenticating users based on their credentials. It takes an Authentication object, containing user-provided credentials, and verifies them against the user details loaded from UserDetailsService. If successful, it creates a fully authenticated Authentication object.

-AuthenticationManager: the central component of the authentication process in Spring Security. It delegates the authentication request to one or more AuthenticationProviders. 

-AuthenticationFilter: it is a part of the Spring Security filter chain. It intercepts incoming HTTP requests and checks if the request contains authentication information.
```

## Q14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
```
It takes lots of memory when there are lot of session. We can set a proper time-out to reduce and release resources as neeeded
```

## Q15. how to get value from application.properties?
```
Springboot powered annotations can be used
```

## Q16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
```
configure(HttpSecurity) method is used to define security rules for HTTP requests
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) is used to configure the authentication to verify user credentials.
```

## Q17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
```
Spring Security authentication is to use the AuthenticationManager for verifying a user's identity
Spring Security authorization is to, using Authentication objects, determin what actions or resources the authenticated user is allowed to access within a web application
```
