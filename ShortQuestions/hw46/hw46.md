## 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

It aims to modularize cross-cutting concerns in software systems and have following key concepts:

- Aspect: An aspect is a module that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns
- Join Point: A join point represents a specific point in the execution of the application where the aspect can be applied
- Advice: Advice is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point
- Pointcut: A pointcut is a predicate that defines which join points in the application should be affected by a particular aspect
- Weaving: Weaving is the process of applying aspects to the target object to create an advised object

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

advantage
- easy configure
- cross-cutting to decoupling
disadvantage
- only public 
- hard debug

--- 

## 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?

Aspects in Spring AOP are used to separate these cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic of the application.

---

## 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?

Pointcuts allow you to precisely control where and when an aspect's advice should be applied, making it possible to target specific methods, classes, or packages to apply cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, etc.) without affecting the entire codebase.

---

## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?

In the context of Spring AOP, join points typically include method execution, method call, constructor execution, constructor call, field access, and exception handling. Each of these points represents a distinct event or action during the execution of the application.

---

## 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?


In Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), advice refers to the additional behavior that is applied to specific join points in the application's execution flow.

- Before
- After
- After Returning
- After Throwing
- Around

## 10. When to use Spring Batch?

Spring Batch is a powerful framework for handling batch processing tasks. You should consider using Spring Batch when your application requires the processing of large volumes of data or repetitive tasks that don't need user interaction

---

## 11. How Spring Batch works?

Spring Batch works based on a well-defined architecture that allows you to build and execute batch processing tasks efficiently. It follows a series of steps and components to perform batch processing tasks.

---

## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

- Using Spring's Task Scheduling: @Configuration + @EnableScheduling on method title, and @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?")

---

## 13. What is the cron expression?

A cron expression is a string that represents a schedule for recurring tasks, commonly used in Unix-like operating systems and scheduling systems.

\* * * * * symbol:
    
- minute
- hour
- day of month
- month
- day of week (0-6)

---

## 14. What is the spring task?

In Spring Framework, the "Spring Task" refers to the built-in task scheduling support provided by Spring's Task Execution and Scheduling framework. 

---

## 15. When to use Spring task?

In summary, choose TaskExecutor when you need to execute tasks asynchronously and concurrently without waiting for a direct response

---

## 16. What is Filter and any filter example?

A filter in the context of web applications is a component in Java that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses before they reach the servlet or after they leave the servlet. Filters are used to perform pre-processing or post-processing tasks on the incoming requests or outgoing responses, such as authentication, logging, security checks, compression, encoding, setting response headers, and more.

---

## 17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?

an interceptor is a component that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses before they reach the controller or after they leave the controller.

---

## 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

- The preHandle method is called before the actual handler method (controller method) is invoked for processing the request.
- The return value of preHandle determines whether the request should continue to be processed or not. If true is returned, the request processing will continue to the controller's method

- The postHandle method is called after the controller's method has completed its execution but before the view is rendered and returned to the client.

## 19. What is Swagger?

API documentation and testing.
