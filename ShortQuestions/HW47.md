**2.  what is selenium?**
Selenium is a popular open-source automation testing framework used to automate web browsers. It allows testers and developers to interact with web elements and validate web application functionalities. Selenium provides a set of APIs that enable actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages, and verifying page content. It is widely used for functional testing, regression testing, and browser compatibility testing.

**3.  what is cucumber?**
Cucumber is a tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) by allowing collaboration between different stakeholders, such as developers, testers, and business analysts. It uses a plain-text domain-specific language called Gherkin to describe the application's behavior in a structured format. Gherkin scenarios are written in a human-readable format that can be understood by non-technical stakeholders. Cucumber then allows the automation of these scenarios by mapping them to executable test code written in various programming languages.

**4.  what is JMeter?**
Apache JMeter is an open-source performance testing tool designed to test the performance and load of web applications and other services. It simulates multiple users or concurrent users to analyze the application's behavior under different load conditions. JMeter allows users to create test plans, configure various performance metrics, and generate performance reports. It is commonly used to identify bottlenecks and performance issues in web applications.

**5.  What is the lifecircle of Junit?**
The lifecycle of JUnit refers to the sequence of events that occur when running JUnit tests within a test class. The typical lifecycle events are as follows:
- @BeforeClass: This method is executed once before any of the test methods in the class. It is usually used for setting up common resources or data required for all test methods.
- @Before: This method is executed before each individual test method. It is used to set up the test environment specific to each test case.
- @Test: This annotation marks a method as a test case. Each method annotated with @Test is executed independently.
- @After: This method is executed after each individual test method. It is used to clean up the test environment and release any resources used during the test.
- @AfterClass: This method is executed once after all the test methods in the class have been executed. It is used for releasing resources or performing cleanup tasks that apply to the entire test class.

**6.  Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?**
Yes, in JUnit 5, the @BeforeAll method must be static because it is invoked before any instance of the test class is created. This annotation is used to perform setup tasks that apply to the entire class, and since it runs before any object is created, it needs to be associated with the class itself rather than any specific instance.

**7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?**
Mockito is an open-source Java testing framework that allows the creation of mock objects to facilitate unit testing. Mock objects are used to simulate the behavior of real objects and dependencies that a class under test interacts with. Mockito provides methods to mock and stub methods of dependencies, allowing testers to control the behavior of these dependencies during testing.

Limitations of Mockito:
- Mockito cannot mock final classes or methods.
- It cannot mock static methods directly.
- Mockito cannot mock private methods.

Tools that can help with testing and mocking in addition to Mockito are PowerMockito and JMockit. These tools can handle more complex scenarios like mocking final classes/methods or static methods.

**8.  What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?**
In Mockito, @Mock and @InjectMocks are annotations used to create mock objects and inject them into the class under test.
@Mock: This annotation is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. When a test class is initialized, Mockito creates a mock instance for every field annotated with @Mock.

@InjectMocks: This annotation is used to inject the mock objects created with @Mock into the class under test. It automatically injects the mocked dependencies into the corresponding fields of the class under test.

**9.  What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?**
Stubbing refers to defining the behavior of mock objects when their methods are called during test execution. By stubbing methods, you specify what the mocked object should return when specific methods are invoked. This allows you to create controlled and predictable scenarios during testing.
For example, let's say you have a service interface UserService with a method getUserById, and you want to test a class that depends on this service. You can stub the behavior of the getUserById method to return a predefined user object when called with a specific user ID. This allows you to isolate the class under test from the actual database or service and ensures consistent and expected behavior during testing.

**10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers**
Mockito is a popular Java testing framework used for writing unit tests. Mockito provides various utilities for creating mock objects and verifying interactions with them. ArgumentMatchers is a class within Mockito that provides methods to define argument matching behaviors for mocked method calls. For example, you can use ArgumentMatchers.any() to match any argument of a specific type or ArgumentMatchers.eq(value) to match a specific value.

**11. what is Hamcrest Matchers**
Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects that allow you to express complex assertions in a readable and concise way. Hamcrest matchers are often used in conjunction with testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG. These matchers can be used to make assertions about the behavior of code.

**12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?**
In Mockito, @Mock is used to create a mock instance of a class or interface, and it initializes all the methods with default values (usually null or 0). On the other hand, @Spy is used to create a spy instance, which is a partial mock. The spy retains the real behavior of the methods unless you explicitly stub them. In other words, when you use @Spy, real methods are invoked unless they are stubbed.

**13. What is assertion?**
An assertion is a statement in a test that checks whether a certain condition is true. It's used to validate that the expected behavior of the code being tested matches the actual outcome. In testing, assertions are used to ensure that the results are consistent with what is anticipated. If an assertion fails, it indicates that there's a problem with the code being tested.

**14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?**
When developing a new feature, you might consider writing the following types of tests:
- Unit Tests: These tests focus on testing individual units or components of your code in isolation. They are usually small in scope and ensure that each part of your code works correctly.
- Integration Tests: Integration tests check how different units of your application work together. They ensure that the interactions between various components are functioning as expected.
- Functional Tests: These tests verify that your feature works as intended from an end-user perspective. They simulate user interactions and test the feature's behavior in real-world scenarios.
- Regression Tests: Regression tests ensure that the new feature doesn't break existing functionality. They are especially important when making changes to existing code.
- Performance Tests: Performance tests assess how well your new feature performs under different conditions, such as load testing to determine its responsiveness and scalability.
- Security Tests: If applicable, security tests can be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that the new feature doesn't introduce security risks.
