### 2 What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.  
Java Spring Boot is an open-source tool that makes it easier to use Java-based frameworks to create microservices and web apps.  
- To ease the Java-based applications Development, Unit Test and Integration Test Process.
- To reduce Development, Unit Test and Integration Test time by providing some defaults.
- To increase Productivity.

### 3 What is IOC and What is DI?
Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle.  
Spring Dependency injection is a way to inject the dependency of a framework component by the following ways of spring: Constructor Injection and Setter Injection. Dependency Injection is the main functionality provided by Spring IOC(Inversion of Control).  

### 4 What is @CompnonentScan?
@ComponentScan is an annotation used in the Spring Framework for auto-detecting and registering Spring-managed components (e.g. beans, controllers, services, repositories, etc.) within a specified package or set of packages.

### 5 How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
using either XML configuration or annotations

### 6 What is @SpringbootApplication?
Spring Boot @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning. It's same as declaring a class with @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations.

### 7 How many ways wo can define a bean?
There are three different ways in which you can define a Spring bean:
- annotating your class with the stereotype @Component annotation (or its derivatives)
- writing a bean factory method annotated with the @Bean annotation in a custom Java configuration class
- declaring a bean definition in an XML configuration file

### 8 What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
For @Component, the default bean name is the uncapitalized non-qualified class name.  
For @Bean, the default bean name is the name of the method that is annotated. 

### 9 What is the difference between @component and @service, @repository?
@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component or bean. @Repository is a stereotype for the persistence layer. @Service is a stereotype for the service layer.

### 10 How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
- @Resource: name -> type -> qualifier.
- @Inject: type -> qualifier -> name.
- @Autowired: type -> qualifier -> name. Autowired annotation is part of the Spring framework.

### 11 Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, Field Injection  
Constructor injection is better.
- Better testability. You do not need any mocking library or a Spring context in unit tests. You can create an object that you want to test with the new keyword. Such tests are always faster because they not rely on the reflection mechanism.
- Immutability. Once the dependencies are set they cannot be changed.
- The dependencies can be final, which helps with robustness and thread-safety.
- Cleaner expression of mandatory dependencies. Field injection is ambiguous in this matter.

### 12 If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
Designate one of them as the primary bean using the @Primary annotation. If no primary bean is defined, use the @Qualifier annotation to specify a specific bean to be injected based on its name or another custom annotation.

### 13 What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
The BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it.

### 14 What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
- singleton: This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).
- prototype: This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.
- request: This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
- session: This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
- global-session: This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
