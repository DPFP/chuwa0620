## Q2 What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
Spring is an open-source Java framework for building enterprise applications. It provides a lightweight, flexible, and modular development environment, simplifying Java development and offering features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and transaction management to help developers build high-quality applications quickly.  

Spring Boot is a rapid development framework based on the Spring framework. It simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications through automatic configuration and convention over configuration principles. It offers an out-of-the-box development environment, allowing developers to focus more on business logic and less on tedious configurations.

Benefits:  
1. Rapid Startup and Development  
2. Less Configuration Hassle
3. Embedded Servers
4. Automatic Dependency Management
5. Microservices Support
6. Health Monitoring and Metrics

## Q3 What is IOC and What is DI?
IOC (Inversion of Control) flips the control of object creation and management to an external container, promoting loose coupling.

DI (Dependency Injection) is a specific implementation of IOC, where dependencies are injected into classes rather than created by them. This enhances flexibility and testability.

## Q4 What is  @CompnonentScan?
@ComponentScan is an annotation used in Spring to enable automatic component scanning and registration of Spring beans. When you use @ComponentScan in your Spring configuration class, Spring will automatically scan the specified packages and sub-packages for classes annotated with stereotype annotations such as @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, etc.

## Q5 How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton? 
1. XML Configuration:  
In XML configuration, you can use the <context:component-scan> element to specify the base package for component scanning. 

2. Annotation Configuration:
In annotation-based configuration, you can use the @ComponentScan annotation to define the base package for component scanning.

## Q6 What is @SpringbootApplication?
@SpringBootApplication is a meta-annotation in Spring Boot that combines three commonly used annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. It is used to annotate the main class of a Spring Boot application to enable various features and configurations provided by Spring Boot.

## Q7 How many ways we can define a bean?
1. XML Configuration
2. Java Configuration
3. Component Scanning

## Q8 What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
When you use @Component to annotate a class, the default bean name is the uncapitalized and unqualified name of the class. For example, if you have a class named MyComponent, the default bean name will be myComponent.  

When you use @Bean to define a method that returns a bean in a @Configuration class, the default bean name is the uncapitalized and unqualified name of the method. For example, if you have a method named myBean() in a @Configuration class, the default bean name will be myBean.

## Q9 What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
### @Component:
@Component is a generic stereotype annotation that can be used for any Spring bean. It is the most basic and general-purpose stereotype annotation.  
Use @Component when you have a general-purpose bean that doesn't fit the more specific stereotypes like @Service or @Repository.  
It is used to mark a class as a Spring bean and make it eligible for automatic component scanning.

### @Service:
@Service is a specialization of the @Component annotation. It is used to indicate that a class is a service component in the business logic layer of the application.  
Use @Service when you want to define a bean that represents a service or business logic component. It is typically used for service classes that handle business operations and service layer functionality.  
It is also used to mark a class as a Spring bean and make it eligible for automatic component scanning.

### @Repository:
@Repository is another specialization of the @Component annotation. It is used to indicate that a class is a data access component, typically used for interacting with databases or external data sources.  
Use @Repository when you want to define a bean that represents a data repository or data access component. It is typically used for DAO (Data Access Object) classes that handle database operations and data access.  
Like @Service, @Repository is also used to mark a class as a Spring bean and make it eligible for automatic component scanning.

## Q10 How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
1. @Autowired
2. @Resource
3. @Qualifier
4. @Value
5. @Lazy
6. @Required

## Q11 Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
1. Constructor Injection
2. Setter Injection
3. Field Injection

Constructor Injection is generally considered the best practice in Spring due to its advantages in terms of maintainability, immutability, testability, and clear dependencies contract. 

## Q12 If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
We can use the @Primary annotation to indicate that one of the beans is the primary bean for that type. This means that if multiple beans match a dependency injection point, Spring will use the primary bean by default.


If there is no primary bean defined for a specific type, Spring will try to resolve the bean by following these rules:

1. If there is only one bean of the required type, Spring will use that bean for injection.
2. If there are multiple beans of the required type and no primary bean is defined, Spring will throw an exception, indicating that there is more than one bean that matches the injection point, and it cannot determine which one to use.

To avoid the exception when no primary bean is defined, you can use the @Autowired annotation along with the @Qualifier annotation to specify the name of the bean you want to inject.

## Q13 What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
BeanFactory is the basic container in Spring that provides essential bean management features with lazy initialization, while ApplicationContext extends the functionality of BeanFactory, offering additional features and capabilities with eager bean initialization. ApplicationContext is generally preferred for most Spring applications due to its enhanced features and ease of use. However, if you have resource constraints or need more control over bean instantiation, BeanFactory might be a suitable choice.

## Q14 What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
1. Singleton(default scope)   eg: @Component, @Service
2. Prototype  eg: @Scope("prototype")
3. Request  eg: @Scope("request")
4. Session  eg: @Scope("session")
5. Global Session  eg: @Scope("globalSession")
6. Application  eg: @Scope("application")
7. WebSocket  eg: @Scope("websocket")

## Q15 Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? 
```XML
<!-- Define the dependency bean -->
<bean id="myDependency" class="com.example.MyDependency">
    <!-- You can also configure any properties of the MyDependency bean here -->
</bean>

<!-- Define the MyBean bean with its dependency -->
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <!-- Inject the MyDependency bean as a constructor argument -->
    <constructor-arg ref="myDependency" />
</bean>
```
