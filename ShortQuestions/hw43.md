# 2.  What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
Spring Framework is an open-source application framework for Java that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, like Dependency Injection, Aspect oriented Programming.

Spring Boot is a sub-project of the Spring Framework that provides an opinionated approach to building production-ready Spring applications. It aims to simplify the configuration and deployment of Spring applications by providing a set of sensible defaults and auto-configurations.

Benefits of Spring boot include: 
- Rapid development
- Easy deployment
- Production-ready features

# 3.  What is IOC and What is DI?

**IOC**: a design pattern where the control of the flow of a program is transferred from the program itself to an external component or framework. Instead of the application managing the creation and lifecycle of its dependencies, IOC delegates that responsibility to a container or framework.

**DI**: a specific implementation of the Inversion of Control principle. It is a technique where the dependencies required by a class are "injected" or provided from outside the class, rather than the class creating or looking up the dependencies itself.

# 4.  What is  @CompnonentScan?
@ComponentScan is an annotation used to specify the base package(s) where Spring should scan for components

# 5.  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

**In XML**: use the \<context:component-scan> element to specify the base package(s) for Spring component scanning.

**Annotation**: use @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.app")

# 6.  What is  @SpringbootApplication?
a core annotation in Spring Boot that combines three commonly used annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. It is a meta-annotation that simplifies the configuration of Spring Boot applications and is usually placed on the main class of a Spring Boot application.

# 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
1. XML
2. Java Configuration with @Configuration and @Bean
3. use @ComponentScan
4. use @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller

# 8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
**@Component**: the default bean name is derived from the class name with the first letter in lowercase

**@Bean**: the default bean name is the name of the method used to create the bean. 

# 9.  What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?

@Component is the most general stereotype annotation and can be used to annotate any Spring-managed component. It doesn't provide any specific behavior or specialization beyond marking a class as a Spring bean.

@Service is a specialization of @Component and is typically used to annotate service classes in the service layer. It indicates that the annotated class is a service component that performs some business logic or acts as an intermediary between the presentation and data access layers.

@Repository is also a specialization of @Component and is intended to be used for classes that access the database or external data sources. It is commonly used in the data access layer (DAO - Data Access Object) to indicate that the annotated class deals with data access and persistence.

# 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
- @Autowired
- @Qualifier
- @Resource
- @Value

# 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
1. Constructor Injection
2. Setter Injection
3. Field Injection

Constructor Injection is better. Constructor injection promotes immutability, as dependencies are provided through the constructor and cannot be changed after the object is created. Also, the dependencies are explicitly declared as parameters, making it clear what the dependencies of the class are.

# 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay

use the @Primary annotation

If no primary: use @Qualifier along with @Autowired to indicate the specific bean name.

# 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
BeanFactory: The BeanFactory performs dependency resolution and injection when a bean is requested. It supports basic dependency injection features like constructor injection and property injection.

ApplicationContext: The ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory and adds more advanced features, such as support for internationalization, message handling, event publication, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and integration with other Spring frameworks like Spring Security and Spring Web.

# 14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope
- Singleton: The Spring container creates only one instance of the bean and returns the same instance for all requests. It is the default scope in Spring, and the container maintains a single shared instance of the bean.

- prototype: The Spring container creates a new instance of the bean for each request (i.e., each time the bean is injected or looked up). Each instance is independent, and changes to one instance do not affect other instances.

- request: This scope is specific to web applications. A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request. It is useful for scenarios where you need a separate instance per user request.

- session: This scope is specific to web applications. A new instance of the bean is created for each user session (HTTP session). It is useful for scenarios where you need a separate instance per user session.

- global session: This scope is specific to web applications and is similar to the session scope. However, it is only used when the application is running in a portlet context, where a global session is shared across multiple portlets.

# 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? 
Use <property name="" value=""/> or <property name="" ref=""/> for bean property
