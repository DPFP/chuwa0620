Spring is a popular open-source framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. The primary goal of the Spring framework is to make it easier to create well-structured, modular, and maintainable applications. It achieves this by promoting loose coupling between components, enabling better testing, and fostering good software design practices. 

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies and accelerates the process of building stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications. It was introduced by the Spring team to streamline the setup and configuration of Spring-based applications.

In simpler terms, IoC means that the responsibility for creating, managing, and connecting components of an application is shifted from the application code to a container or framework. The container takes charge of instantiating objects, managing their lifecycle, and injecting dependencies between them. This results in a more decoupled and flexible architecture, making it easier to change or extend the behavior of an application.

Dependency Injection is a specific implementation of the Inversion of Control principle. It is a design pattern used to achieve loose coupling between classes in an application. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies, those dependencies are provided (injected) from the outside.

When you annotate a configuration class or the main application class with @ComponentScan, Spring will scan the specified packages and their sub-packages for classes annotated with stereotype annotations such as @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, etc. Spring will then automatically create bean instances for these classes and add them to the application context, making them available for dependency injection and other Spring features.

## 5
In annotation use @ComponentScan.
In xml add <content>.

## 6
@Configuration, @ComponentScan, @EnableAutoConfiguration

## 7
Three. class level annotation such as @Service or Method level @Bean or in xml.

## 8
@Component is the class name.
@Bean is the method name.

## 9
Use @Component for general-purpose beans that do not fall into the specific categories of service or repository.
Use @Service to annotate service layer components that hold the business logic of the application.
Use @Repository to annotate data access components responsible for interacting with the database or external data sources.

## 10
@Inject, @Resource, @Autowired

## 11
Constructor injection, field injection, or setter injection.
Constructor injection is better for test friendly and avoid circular dependency.

## 12
Use @Primary or @Qualifier

## 13
In Spring Framework, BeanFactory and ApplicationContext are two interfaces that play a central role in managing beans (objects) and providing various services within the Spring container. Both are responsible for handling bean instantiation, dependency injection, and managing the lifecycle of beans, but they have some differences in functionality and usage.

## 14
In Spring, the scope of a bean defines the lifecycle and visibility of instances created from that bean definition within the Spring container. The scope determines how Spring manages and provides instances of a particular bean.

Singleton (default), Prototype, Request, Session, Global Session
