# HW42 exception validation

### 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?
@Configuration is an annotation used to indicate that a Java class is a configuration class, defining the Spring bean configuration. In other words, classes annotated with @Configuration are used to define Spring beans and their relationships. This approach is an alternative to the traditional XML-based configuration.

@Bean is an annotation used within a @Configuration-annotated class to declare a Spring bean. Methods annotated with @Bean produce bean instances that will be managed by the Spring container.

### 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
@ExceptionHandler: You can use the @ExceptionHandler annotation at the method level to handle specific exceptions for a particular controller or across the entire application.

Another way is using @ControllerAdvice,which the class will becomes a global advisor that applies to all controllers in the application. It can intercept and handle exceptions thrown by controller methods, preprocess data before it is bound to the model, and provide common model attributes for all controller methods.

### 4. How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotaitons you know.
validation annotations from the javax.validation.constraints package, custom validators, and Spring's Validator interface.

@NotNull: The annotated element must not be null.
@NotBlank: The annotated string must not be null and must contain at least one non-whitespace character.
@NotEmpty: The annotated element must not be null and must contain at least one element (for collections and arrays).
@Size: The annotated element size must be within the specified bounds.

@Email: The annotated string must be a well-formed email address.
@Pattern: The annotated string must match the specified regular expression pattern.

### 5. What is the actuator?
Spring Boot Actuator is a subproject of Spring Boot that provides production-ready features to monitor and manage your application easily. It offers several built-in endpoints that allow you to monitor various aspects of your application, such as health, metrics, environment properties, logging, and more. Actuator simplifies the process of gathering crucial runtime information and insights about your application without requiring additional dependencies or configurations.
