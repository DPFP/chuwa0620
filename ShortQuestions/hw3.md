2. 
    Checked Exceptions:These are the exceptions that a programmer should anticipate and provide a means of handling it eg. RuntimeException
    Unchecked Exceptions:These are exceptions that occur due to programming errors, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. eg.IllegalArgumentException
3. No.There can only be one finally block, 
4.  The return value from the finally block will be the one that is actually returned, overriding the value from the catch block.
5.  Same answer as question #2
6. throw is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code.
   throws is used to declare an exception, which lets the programmer and compiler know that this method might throw this type of exception. It is always used with a method signature.
7. Because Null/RuntimeException are subclass of Exception. If we put Exception before its subclass, all exception will be catch by Exception.
7.  The key characteristic of the finally block is that it is guaranteed to execute, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not, or whether it's caught or not in the try block.
8.  Singleton, Adapter, Factory
9. SOLID
    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP),Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle
10.  Double-checked Locking
11. OPC:  Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.
