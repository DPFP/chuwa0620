Eager load
```
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();

    // private constructor
    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return this.instance;
    }
    
}
```

Lazy load
```
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // private constructor
    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null)
            this.instance = new Singleton();
        
        return this.instance;
    }
    
}
```

In Java, a runtime exception refers to an exception that can occur during the execution of a program at runtime. Eg, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, etc.

## 7
```
public class User {
    private int age;

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

// let's say we have an api that can get a user, or null.
User a = getUser();

System.out.print(a.getAge()) // this line may cause NPE since a might be null;
```

## 8
The Optional class in Java is a container class introduced in Java 8 as part of the Java.util package. It is designed to represent an optional value, which means it can either contain a non-null value or be empty.

## 9
Null-Safety: Optional provides a null-safe way of handling values. It allows you to express the absence of a value without resorting to using null references.

Readability: By using Optional, you make your code more readable and self-explanatory. It clearly communicates the possibility of a value being absent, which enhances code understanding and maintainability.

## 10
@FunctionalInterface is an annotation in java, with such annotation, java will check whether the interface have one and only one abstract method.

## 11
Lambda is the implmentation of the abstract method.

## 12
Method reference is a simplified way of lambda.

## 13
- Reference
- Lambda and functional interface
- optional
- streamAPI

## 14
Yes, it can use variables in the following conditions:
- Final variable
- Non-final variable however never changed
- Object variable (if we use new to reassign a new memory, then this variable is changed, can not be used in lambda)

## 15
- Reference
- Lambda and functional interface
- optional
- streamAPI

## 16
Yes.

## 17
A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an anonymous functionâ€”a function without a name that can be treated as a value. It provides a more compact and expressive syntax for implementing functional interfaces.

A functional interface is an interface that declares exactly one abstract method and is annotated with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation. Lambda expressions can be used to provide an implementation for the abstract method of a functional interface.

## 18
Method Reference is a simplifed way of doing lambda.

## 19
String::valueOf is a method reference that refers to the valueOf method of the String class. It represents a shorthand way to create a lambda expression that calls the valueOf method with a given argument.

## 20
Intermediate operations are used to process data, include filter...

Terminal operations are used to collect data, include collect...

## 21
filter, limit, skip, map...

## 22
findFirst() returns th first element in the stream and findAny() return the first element that satisfy certain condition, they are both terminal operations that only return 1 value.

## 23
Stream is a fixed data set, cannot add or modify where as collections can.

Stream elements can only be accessed in sequence, where as collections can access in any order.
