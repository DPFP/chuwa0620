### 5.Write the Singleton design pattern include eager load and lazy load. 
1. Eager load:
'''
public void EagerSingleton(){
    private EagerSingleton(){};
    private static EagerSingleton instance = new EagerSingleton();
    public static EagerSingleton getInstance(){
        return Instance;
    }
}
'''

2. Lazy load:
'''
public void synchronized LazySingleton(){
    private LazySingleton(){};
    private static LazySingleton instance;
    public static LazySingleton getInstance(){
        if(instance == null){
            instance = new LazySingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
'''

### 6.What is Runtime Exception? could you give me some examples?
Also known as unchecked exception, they are not checked during compile-time and occur during the execution of the program, forexample NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Arithmetic Exception.

### 7.Could you give me one example of NullPointerException?
'''
public void ExmapleofNPE(){
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String x=null;
        System.out.println(x.charAt(4));
    }
}
'''

### 8.What is the Optional class?
Optional class is a container class that is designed to represent an optional value. The value in the optional class may nor may not be present. It is a good way to deal with NullPointerException.

### 9.What are the advantages of using the Optional class?
The most advantage is that optional class is Null safe, it eliminate the null pointer exception when the value is not present. It also improve the readability of the code, instead of checking null with multiple if else statements, optional class provide a linear statement which is better to read.

### 10.What is the @FunctionalInterface?
@FunctionalInterface is a marker annotation that is used to check if an interface has and only has one abstract method.

### 11.what is lambda?
Lambda is form of expression that provide a way to write more compact code. Instead of declearing or naming the method, it directly expressing the behavior as a method argument. It is compiled into instance of functional interface at runtime.

### 12.What is Method Reference?
Method reference is a feature introduce in Java 8 that allow to refer a method using shorter syntax, it provide a way to pass a method as an arguement without writing lambda expression. The syntax is using "::" operation.

### 13.What is Java 8 new features?
Lambda Expression, functional interface, Stream API, Default methods for interface, Method reference, optional, Data and Time API, Parallel and Asynchronous Programming, Nashorn JavaScript Engine

### 14.Lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda? what is the details?
Yes, lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda, as long as the variable is final and not be changed.

### 15.Describe the newly added features in Java 8?
1.Lambda Expression: Lambda is a form of expression that make code more compact, it compiles into instance of functional behavior and instead of declearing the method name, it express the behavior as arguement into method.
2.Functional interface: Functional interface is the interface that have and only have one abstract method.
3.Stream API: The Steam API provide an approach to process collections of data, like filtering, mapping, reducing dimension.
4.Default methods for interface: In the interface, default method allow the interface to have method implementation so that those methods do not need to be override for multiple times.
5.Method reference: Method reference allow to refer method in shorter way, it can pass an method as arguement without lambda function by using "::" operation.
6.Optional class: Optional class is a method to eliminate null pointer exception and provide a container class, it makes the code more concise and more readable.
7.Data and Time API: It is used to provide more thread-safe, immutable and easy to use time and data functions.
8.Parallel and Asynchronous Programming: It is the method that help to simplify the asynochronous programming.
9.Nashorn JavaScript Engine: Allow to execute JavaScript code within Java application.

### 16.Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?
Functional interface can inherit another interface since the abstract method of other interface is not the abstract method of the functional interface, which means the functional interface has and only has one abstract method. Functional method can not extend other interface since it will not have only one abstract method.

### 17.What is the lambda expression in Java and How does a lambda expression relate to a functional interface?
Lambda expression is a concise way to represet anonymous functions, it provide a way to write behavior as argument. Lambda expression can be used as implementation of the functional interface. 

### 18.In Java 8, what is Method Reference?
Method reference is an approach to refer method in a shorter syntax, by using "::" operation, it can pass method as arguement without lambda expression.

### 19.What does the String::ValueOf expression mean?
It is a method reference, it refer the Valueof method of String class.

### 20.What are Intermediate and Terminal operations?
Intermediate operations are operation that applied on stream to produce a new stream as the result, like "map" or "filter". Termainal operations are operations that applied on stream for the terminal operation or error throwing operation, which will end the stream, like "forEach" or "collect".

### 21.What are the most commonly used Intermediate operations?
filter, map, flatMap, distinct, sorted, limit, skip, peek

### 22.What is the difference between findFirst() and findAny()?
findFirst() is to find the first element that fit the condition, findAny() will return any element that fit the condition, which might not be the first one.

### 23.How are Collections different from Stream?
Collection is eager storage of data, Stream is lazy storage of data. Collection has data structure like List, Set, Stream do not has data structure but provide approachs to process data. Collection do not support parallel programming, but Stream support.
