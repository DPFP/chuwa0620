1. Generics means parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc., and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. Using Generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types. 
5. 
Eager load 
 ```
 public class Singleton {
    // 1, private static variable
    private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    private Singleton() {
    }
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
            return instance;
        }
    }
 ```
 lazy load
 ```
   public class LazySingleton {
       private static LazySingleton instance;
       private LazySingleton() {
       }
       public static synchronized LazySingleton getInstance() {
           if (instance == null) {
               instance = new LazySingleton();
           }
           return instance;
       }
   }
 ```
 6. runtime exceptions are internal to your application but are not typically recoverable. For example, an object that is expected to have a value but is actually null.
 7. Some of the most common scenarios for a NullPointerException are: Calling methods on a null object. Accessing a null object's properties. Accessing an index element (like in an array) of a null object
 8. The Optional class in Java is a container that can hold, at max, one value and gracefully deals with null values. 
 9. We can use the Optional class to wrap our data and avoid the classical null checks and some of the try-catch blocks. As a result, we'll be able to chain method calls and have more fluent, functional code. 
 10. A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains only a single abstract (unimplemented) method.
 11. A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. It's an expression that represents an instance of a functional interface.
 12. Method references are a special type of lambda expressions.
They're often used to create simple lambda expressions by referencing existing methods. There are four kinds of method references: Static methods. Instance methods of particular objects. Instance methods of an arbitrary object of a particular type.
13. forEach() method in Iterable interface. default and static methods in Interfaces. Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions. Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections.
14. yes final variable or Non-final variable however never changed
15. Lambda Expressions, a new language feature, has been introduced in this release. They enable us to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.
16. A functional interface can extends another interface only when it does not have any abstract method.
17. A lambda expression (lambda) is a short-form replacement for an anonymous class. Lambdas simplify the use of interfaces that declare single abstract methods.
18.  Method reference is used to refer method of the functional interface.
19.   valueOf() in Java is used to convert any non String variable or Object such as int, double, char, and others to a newly created String object.
20.   Intermediate operations transform or filter the stream, while terminal operations produce a result or side effect.
21.   filter map distince etc.
22.   Find the first that match the condition and find any element that match the condition 
23.   Collections are mainly used to store and group the data. Streams are mainly used to perform operations on data. You can add or remove elements from collections.
