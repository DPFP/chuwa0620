## 2. What is selenium?
 
simulate user behavior test:

WebDriver - grab web elements  
Page Objects - simulate web page

---

## 3. what is cucumber?

BDD behavior-Driven development (Given, When, Then)

---

## 4. what is JMeter?

Apache JMeter is an open-source software application designed to perform load testing, performance testing, and functional testing of web applications and services.


---

## 5. What is the lifecircle of Junit?

- Test Class Instantiation
- BeforeClass (Static) Setup: @BeforeClass
- Before (Instance) Setup: @Before
- Test Method Execution: @Test
- After (Instance) Teardown: @After
- AfterClass (Static) Teardown: @AfterClass

---

## 6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

yes

---

## 7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?

Mockito is an open-source Java framework used for mocking and stubbing in unit testing.

- Mockito cannot mock final classes or methods, as well as static methods.
-  Mockito cannot mock final or private classes by default.

For scenarios where Mockito's limitations are a concern, developers can consider using alternative mocking libraries like PowerMock or JMockit

---

## 8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

- The @Mock annotation is used to create mock objects for the dependencies of the class under test. When a class is annotated with @Mock, Mockito creates a mock object of that class. This allows you to isolate the class under test from its real dependencies, so you can focus on testing the specific behavior of the class in isolation.

- The @InjectMocks annotation is used to automatically inject the mock objects created with @Mock into the class under test. It simplifies the process of wiring mock dependencies into the class, reducing the need for manual setup.

## 9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

Stubbing, in the context of testing and particularly in mocking frameworks like Mockito, refers to the process of defining the behavior of mock objects. When you create a mock object, it initially has default behavior for all its methods, which typically returns default values (e.g., null for object types, 0 for integers, etc.).

---

## 10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?

Mockito ArgumentMatchers is a feature provided by the Mockito mocking framework that allows you to specify flexible argument matching when setting up expectations and stubbing method calls on mock objects.

---

## 11. what is Hamcrest Matchers

Hamcrest Matchers is a library that provides a set of matchers for creating expressive and readable assertions in unit testing.

---

## 12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

@Spy and @Mock are both annotations provided by the Mockito framework for creating test doubles, but they serve different purposes:

- @Mock: The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock object, which is an object that simulates the behavior of a real object but does not execute the actual implementation of its methods. Mock objects are typically used to isolate the class under test from its dependencies during unit testing.
- @Spy: doReturn("").when(testService).doSomething() æ—¶doSomething is mock otherwise call real method.

---

## 13. What is assertion?

In software testing, an assertion is a statement or check that is used to verify whether a given condition or expectation holds true at a specific point in the code.

---

## 14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?

- unit test: test function or method
- integration test: test interaction between module or components
- functional test: test function
- regression test: test if there is new bugs after modify the code or env
- performance test: test qps like jmeter
- UAT (user acceptance testing): final user test, test if it can execute tasks in real conditions
