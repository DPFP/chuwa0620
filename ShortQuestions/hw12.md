1. Done
2. **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system attempting to access a resource.
3. **Authorization**: The process of determining whether a user or system has the appropriate permissions to access a resource.
4. **Difference between authentication and authorization**: Authentication is about verifying the identity, while authorization is about granting or denying access based on the user's permissions.
5. **HTTP Session**: A mechanism to maintain state between a web server and a web client over multiple requests and responses.
6. **Cookie**: A small piece of data sent by the web server and stored on the web client to maintain state information.
7. **Difference between Session and Cookie**: A session is a server-side mechanism to store data related to a specific user, while a cookie is a client-side mechanism to store data sent by the server.
8. **Using session and cookie to keep user information across the application**: The server uses the session to store user-specific data, and a cookie is sent to the client to reference the session.
9. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties as a JSON object.
10. **Spring Security Filter**: A filter provided by Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization.
11. **How JWT works**: JWT allows secure transmission of information between parties as a JSON object, and it is digitally signed to verify its integrity.
12. **Password Encoder**: No, I don't use Encoder to encode my passwords.
13. **UserDetailsService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, and AuthenticationFilter**: These are components of Spring Security that handle user authentication and authorization.
14. **Disadvantage of Session**: Sessions consume server memory and may not be suitable for scalable applications. To overcome this, JWT or token-based authentication can be used.
15. **Getting value from application.properties**: Use `@Value` annotation or `Environment` to access properties in Spring.
16. **Role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)**: `configure(HttpSecurity http)` is used to configure web security, while `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` is used to configure user authentication.
17. **Spring Security authentication and authorization**: Spring Security provides a robust framework for implementing authentication and authorization in Java applications. It helps secure web applications against various security threats and manage user access to resources.
