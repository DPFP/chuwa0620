## Q2.  What is MVC pattern?
```
Model–view–controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related 
program logic into three interconnected elements
```

## Q3.  What is Front-Controller?
```
 Single handler for all kinds of requests coming to the application (either web based/ desktop based).
 It is part of the front controller design pattern is used to provide a centralized request handling mechanism so 
 that all requests will be handled by a single handler. This handler can do the authentication/ authorization/ logging
  or tracking of request and then pass the requests to corresponding handlers. Following are the entities of this type of design pattern.
```

## Q4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works
```
The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring web applications. It's used to create web applications and
 REST services in Spring MVC. In a traditional Spring web application, this servlet is defined in the web.xml file.
 An example of how it works:
 1.  DispatcherServlet get the request from server and calls the HandlerMapper, 
2.  HanlerMapper return the corresponding controller and method back to the dispactherServlet
3.  dispatcherServlet will call the correponding method from correct controller and call the service, repository
and database
4.  Then the result(ModelAndView) will be returned by controller, normally as a viewname(string) 
5.  dispatcerServlet uses this view name to call the view resolver
6.  view Resolver will find the view template with the view name
7. then the view engine will be called to put the data in the view template and transfer it to an HTML
8. Return the final HTML result
```

## Q5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege
```
Jakarta Server Pages (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages) is a collection of technologies that helps software developers 
create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP, or other document types.
- ModelAndView:

ModelAndView is a value object designed to hold model and view making it possible for a handler to return both model 
and view in a single return value. ModelAndView is resolved by DispatcherServlet using special framework objects ViewResolver and View.

The Model is ais an object which stores the values that need to be sent to views/JSP. It can be a String object which
 has stored a string value. When we have to send many model values, we can store them in Map and object of Map can be used.

The View is a String which is the name of a JSP file or which is the value given for the name attribute of a <bean> tag
 where this <bean> tag corresponds to the class which implements View interface.
```

## Q6.  Could you please google any other servlets
```

```

## Q7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
```
