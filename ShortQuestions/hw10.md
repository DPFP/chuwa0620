## spring data
### 4 what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
Java Persistence API is a collection of classes and methods to persistently store the vast amounts of data into a database which is provided by the Oracle Corporation.  
Hibernate is an open source object relational mapping (ORM) tool that provides a framework to map object-oriented domain models to relational databases for web applications.

### 5 What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
Hikari Connection Pool commonly referred to as HikariCP is a very fast light weight Java connection pool. A connection pool is a cache of database connections. A Connection Pool maintains connections that can be reused when future requests to the database are required.

### 6 What is the @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
- `@OneToMany`: Current class object may contains multiple objects of another class
 ```java
 @OneToMany(mappedBy = "posts", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
 private Set<Comment> comments = new HashSet<>();
 ```
- `@ManyToOne`: Current class objects may be included into on objects of another class
 ```java
 @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
 @JoinColumn(name = "post_id", nullable = false)
 private Post post;
 ```
- `@ManyToMany`: Current class object may contains multiple objects of another class, and vice versa
 ```java
     @ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
     @JoinTable(name = "sku_inventory",
             joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "sku_id"),
             inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "inventory_id"))
     private Set<PmsInventory> pmsInventories = new HashSet<>();
 ```

### 7 What is the cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
All cascading operations on owning entity will be applied to related entity, and if the parent entity is gone, it's related child entity will be removed.
CascadeType:
- Persist: makes a transient instance persistent
- Merge: copies the states of the given object onto the persistent object with the same identifier
- Refresh: rereads the value of a given instance from the database
- Remove: removes the row corresponding the entity from the database and from the persistence context
- Detach: removes the entity from the persistent context
- All: all the operations above

### 8 What is the fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
FetchType.LAZY = This does not load the relationships unless you invoke it via the getter method.  
FetchType.EAGER = This loads all the relationships.  
Lazy initialization improves performance by avoiding unnecessary computation and reduce memory requirements.  
Eager initialization takes more memory consumption and processing speed is slow.

### 9 What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?
Example: findByLastnameOrFirstname(a, b)  
lastname and firstname must be the column name in the table  
find, By, Or is the namespace provided by JPA.  
We don't need to implement the method by ourselves  
examples: findByLastnameAndFirstname(a, b)

### 14 What is JPQL?
JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database. JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax. 

### 15 What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
@NameQueries annotation is used to define the multiple named queries. @NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query.

### 16 What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
We can use @Query annotation to specify a query within a repository.  
We write in the repository interface.

### 17 What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
HQL is to perform both select and non-select operations on the data, but Criteria is only for selecting the data, we cannot perform non-select operations using criteria. HQL is suitable for executing Static Queries, where as Criteria is suitable for executing Dynamic Queries.

### 18 What is EnityManager?
The EntityManager is an API that manages the lifecycle of entity instances. An EntityManager object manages a set of entities that are defined by a persistence unit. Each EntityManager instance is associated with a persistence context.

### 19 What is SessionFactory and Session?
The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application. A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database.

### 20 What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
Transaction represents a unit of work, the operation follows the ACID principle, either the transaction success or fails (corresponds to either commit or rollback)

### 21 What is hibernate Caching?
Caching in Hibernate refers to the technique of storing frequently accessed data in memory to improve the performance of an application that uses Hibernate as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. 

### 22 What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
- First-Level Cache: Hibernate uses a session-level cache, also known as a first-level cache, to store the data that is currently being used by a specific session. When an entity is loaded or updated for the first time in a session, it is stored in the session-level cache. Any subsequent request to fetch the same entity within the same session will be served from the cache, avoiding a database round-trip. The session-level cache is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- Second-Level Cache: Hibernate also supports a second-level cache, which is a shared cache across multiple sessions. This cache stores data that is frequently used across different sessions, reducing the number of database queries and improving the overall performance of the application. 


## exception validation
### 2 what is the @configuration and @bean?
@Configuration annotation is used in Spring Boot to indicate that a class contains one or more bean definitions.  
@Bean is an annotation that is used to declare a method as a bean so, to create a bean in Spring Boot, you simply annotate a method with @Bean.

### 3 How do you handle the exception in Spring?
In Spring, exceptions can be handled using the @ExceptionHandler annotation, which can be applied to a method in a controller class to define how exceptions should be handled.

### 4 How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotaitons you know.
Spring Boot’s Bean Validation support comes with the validation starter.  
- @NotNull: to say that a field must not be null.
- @NotEmpty: to say that a list field must not empty.
- @NotBlank: to say that a string field must not be the empty string (i.e. it must have at least one character).
- @Min and @Max: to say that a numerical field is only valid when it’s value is above or below a certain value.
- @Pattern: to say that a string field is only valid when it matches a certain regular expression.
- @Email: to say that a string field must be a valid email address.

### 5 What is the actuator?
Actuator is mainly used to expose operational information about the running application — health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
