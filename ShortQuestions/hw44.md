MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural pattern used for designing and organizing the structure of applications, especially in web development. It separates an application into three interconnected components to achieve better maintainability, modularity, and code reusability.

The Model represents the application's data and business logic. 
The View is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting the data to the user. 
The Controller is the intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View and processes it, interacting with the Model to update data and business logic as needed.

A Front Controller is a design pattern used in web applications to provide a centralized entry point for handling incoming requests. It acts as a single point of contact for all client requests and is responsible for routing the requests to appropriate handlers or components within the application.

For example, in Spring MVC, the DispatcherServlet serves as the Front Controller. It receives all incoming requests and dispatches them to the relevant controllers based on the defined URL mappings.

In Spring Framework, the DispatcherServlet is a core component responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and managing the overall flow of a web application. It acts as the Front Controller and is a central part of the Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

Request Handling:
When an HTTP request arrives at a Spring-based web application, it is first intercepted by the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet is typically defined in the web.xml (for older XML-based configuration) or the ServletInitializer class (for Java-based configuration) as the main servlet handling all requests.

URL Mapping:
The DispatcherServlet examines the URL of the incoming request to determine which controller or handler should process it. This is possible due to the configuration of URL mappings, which are defined within the Spring configuration.

Handler Mapping:
The DispatcherServlet consults the configured HandlerMapping beans to find the appropriate Controller (or Handler) for the incoming request. The HandlerMapping is responsible for mapping the incoming request to the corresponding controller based on the URL or other request attributes.

Controller Execution:
Once the DispatcherServlet has found the appropriate Controller, it calls the controller's method to process the request. The controller performs the necessary processing, such as handling business logic, accessing the model, or interacting with the database.

Model and View Resolution:
The Controller prepares the data (Model) that needs to be sent to the client. It then returns the logical view name, which represents the view that should be used to render the response. The view name is typically resolved to an actual view template (JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.) using the configured ViewResolver bean.

Rendering the Response:
The DispatcherServlet forwards the model data and the selected view template to the View to render the final response. The View combines the model data with the view template and generates the HTML output.

Sending the Response:
Finally, the DispatcherServlet sends the rendered HTML response back to the client (e.g., web browser).

JSP stands for JavaServer Pages, and it is a technology used for building dynamic web pages in Java-based web applications. JSP allows developers to embed Java code directly into HTML pages, making it easier to generate dynamic content and interact with Java backend components. JSP is a part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specification and is commonly used with Servlets to build web applications.

ModelAndView is a class in Spring Framework used to represent both the data (Model) and the view name to be rendered in a Spring MVC web application. It is often returned by a controller method to indicate the data and the view that should be used to render the response.
