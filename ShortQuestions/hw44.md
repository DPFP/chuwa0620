### 2 What is MVC pattern?
The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of a data model, presentation information, and control information. The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects. MVC is more of an architectural pattern, but not for complete application. MVC mostly relates to the UI / interaction layer of an application. You’re still going to need business logic layer, maybe some service layer and data access layer.

### 3 What is Front-Controller?
The front controller design pattern is used to provide a centralized request handling mechanism so that all requests will be handled by a single handler.

### 4 What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring web applications. It's used to create web applications and REST services in Spring MVC. In a traditional Spring web application, this servlet is defined in the web. xml file.

### 5 What is JSP and What is ModelAndView?(please google to have a basic knowlege)
Jakarta Server Pages (formerly JavaServer Pages) is a Java standard technology that developers use to write dynamic, data-driven web pages for Java web applications. JSP is built on top of the Java Servlet (aka Jakarta Servlet) specification and is one of the Java web technologies included for ongoing support and upgrades in Jakarta EE.  
ModelAndView is a class present in org. springframework. web. servlet package. ModelAndView is a value object designed to hold model and view making it possible for a handler to return both model and view in a single return value.

### 6 Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间， 知道servlet的名字就行。)
- HttpServlet: A base class for servlets that handle HTTP requests and responses. It provides methods for handling various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and for sending HTTP responses.
- Filter: A component that intercepts incoming requests and outgoing responses and performs some processing on them before they are handled by the servlet. Filters are often used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and request/response modification.
- RequestDispatcher: A class that allows a servlet to forward a request to another resource (such as another servlet or a JSP page) for processing. This can be useful for organizing complex request handling logic across multiple servlets or for reusing common functionality.
- HttpSession: A class that represents a user session in a web application. It allows data to be stored and retrieved across multiple requests from the same user, and is often used for storing user-specific information such as login credentials and shopping cart contents.
- ServletContext: A class that represents the web application as a whole. It provides access to application-wide resources such as configuration parameters and shared data structures, and is often used for initializing the application and sharing resources across multiple servlets.

### 7 How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
Tomcat is a servlet container and an open source web server for Java code. It can run Java Server Pages(JSP) and servlets, providing a pure Java web server environment to run Java based applications. The Tomcat contains tools for management and configuration. To configure directly, you need to edit XML configuration files.  
Jetty is an open source Java web server, as well as a servlet container, that provides an application with the features required to launch and run an application servlet or API.  
JBoss is a segment of Red Hat that supports the WildFly open source application server program (also known as JBoss AS) and middleware services. It is an open source alternative to commercial offerings from SAP NetWeaver and IBM WebSphere.
