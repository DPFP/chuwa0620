## Q2 What is MVC pattern?
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it is a software architectural pattern commonly used in building applications with user interfaces. The MVC pattern separates the application into three interconnected components, each with a specific role:

#### Model:

The Model represents the data and business logic of the application.
It encapsulates the data and provides methods to manipulate and access that data.
The Model is responsible for managing the application's state and business rules.
#### View:

The View represents the presentation and user interface of the application.
It is responsible for rendering the data from the Model and displaying it to the user.
The View is passive and does not contain any business logic; its main purpose is to present data to the user in a format that is understandable and user-friendly.
#### Controller:

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
It receives input from the user through the View and processes it.
Based on the user's input, the Controller updates the Model or decides which View to display.
The Controller handles user interactions and updates the state of the Model or updates the View accordingly.

## Q3 What is Front-Controller? 
A Front-Controller is a design pattern used in web application development to handle the incoming requests from clients (usually web browsers) and centralize the processing and dispatching of these requests to appropriate handlers or components within the application. The Front-Controller acts as a central entry point for all requests, providing a common point of control and facilitating request handling.

## Q4 What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
DispatcherServlet is a core component of the Spring MVC framework in Java. It acts as the Front-Controller in a Spring-based web application, responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, determining the appropriate controller to process the request, and dispatching the request to the selected controller for further processing.

## Q5 What is JSP and What is ModelAndView£¿(please google to have a basic knowlege)
JSP is a view technology used for generating dynamic web pages, while ModelAndView is a Spring-specific class used to pass data from the controller to the view and specify the view template to be used for rendering the response.
