### 5.What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ(please google to have a basic knowlege)
JSP stands for JavaServer Pages. It is a technology used for building dynamic web pages in Java-based web applications. JSP enables developers to embed Java code directly into the HTML markup, allowing for the dynamic generation of web content. JSP files have a .jsp extension and are similar to HTML files with embedded Java code.

ModelAndView is a class in the Spring Framework that represents a data model and view information for returning a response from a Spring Controller. In the context of Spring Web MVC, the ModelAndView object is typically used by a controller to pass data (the model) to a view template and specify which view should be used to render the response.
