# 4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works
When an HTTP request arrives at the Spring Web application, it first hits the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet intercepts the incoming request and begins the request processing cycle.The first step is to determine which controller should handle the incoming request. To achieve this, the DispatcherServlet consults the configured HandlerMappings. After the controller has executed, it returns a logical view name that corresponds to the view that should be rendered to the client. The DispatcherServlet then needs to determine which ViewResolver to use. The final step is to use the selected View to generate the response and the DispatcherServlet sends it back to the client as the HTTP response.

ModelAndView is a class provided by the Spring Framework, specifically in the context of the Spring Web MVC module. It represents a container that combines both the model data and the logical view name that should be rendered to generate the HTTP response.
