### What are the layers in springboot application? what is the role of each layer?
Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests, interacting with the clients and return the appropriate response.

Business layer: Also known as service layer, This layer contains business logic and acts as the intermediary layer between the presentation layer and data layer.

Presistence layer: This layer also known as data access layer, it is responsible for interacting with the databases and provide create, read, update and delete operatoions.

Database layer: This layer is where data stored, it is an operating system that manage data in structural manner, it can be relational database management system like MySQL or NoSQL database like mongo DB.

### Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman.
Postman send an HTTP request to specific endpoint of the API, this request is recieved by the controller and handled to generate a response in the presentation layer. Then in the service layer, the controller push the processing to the appropriate service layer component. Then the service layer will retrieve or presist data from the presistence layer, and the presistence layer will interact with the database layer to retrive or presist with specific data.

### What is the application.properties? do you know application.yml?
Application.proporities is a plain text file that is key-value format. For example:

spring.datasource.username=root

server.port=8080

Application.yml is an alternative configuration file format supported by Spring Boot. It uses a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) syntax, which is a human-readable structured data format. For example:

server:
  port: 8080
spring:
  datasource:
