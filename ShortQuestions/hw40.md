## Q1 create a file to list all of the annotaitons you learned and known, and explain the usage and how do you understand it. you need to update it when you learn a new annotation. Please organize those annotations well, like annotations used by entity, annotations used by controller.
1.  File name: annotations.md
2.  you'd better also list a code example under the annotations.

@Entity
mark a class as a persistent entity in a database.
```Java
@Entity
public class User {
    // Class definition
}
```

@Table
used to specify the details of the database table corresponding to an entity class.
```Java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    // Class definition
}
```

@Column  
used to specify the details of a column in a database table.
```Java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "user_id")
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "username")
    private String username;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

@Id  
used to mark a field as the primary key of an entity.
```Java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "user_id")
    private Long id;

    // Other fields and methods
}
```

@GeneratedValue  
used to specify the generation strategy for the values of an annotated field.
```Java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "user_id")
    private Long id;

    // Other fields and methods
}
```

@Controller  
used to mark a class as a controller in a Spring MVC application.
```Java
@Controller
public class UserController {
    // Class definition
}
```

@RequestMapping  
used to map a URL pattern to a method in a controller class.
```Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

@PathVariable  
used to extract a path variable from a URL and bind it to a method parameter in a controller.
```Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

@RequestParam  
 used to extract query parameters from a URL and bind them to method parameters in a controller.
 ```Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String getUsersByRole(@RequestParam("role") String role) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
 ```

 @RequestBody  
  used to bind the request body to a method parameter in a controller.
  ```Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    @PostMapping("/")
    public String createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
  ```


  ## Q2 explain how the below annotaitons specify the table in database?

```Java
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")
private String name;
  
@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName;
```
The @Column annotation is used to specify the details of a column in a database table. The columnDefinition attribute is used to specify the column definition directly in the database-specific DDL (Data Definition Language) syntax. In this case, it defines the column as a varchar(255) data type with a default value of 'John Snow'. This means that the column named name in the corresponding table will be of type varchar(255) and will have a default value of 'John Snow' if no other value is explicitly provided.

The name attribute is used to specify the name of the column in the database table. In this case, the column name will be "STUDENT_NAME". The length attribute is used to set the maximum length of the column. The nullable attribute is used to indicate whether the column allows null values (false means it is not nullable). The unique attribute specifies whether the column values must be unique (false means duplicates are allowed).


## Q3 What is the default column names of the table in database for  @Column?
```Java
@Column
private String firstName;
@Column
private String operatingSystem;
```
first_name, operating_system

## Q4 What are the layers in springboot application? what is the role of each layer?
### Presentation Layer:
Controller: handles incoming requests, interacts with the appropriate services and prepares the data to be displayed in the view.

View: rendering the user interface and displaying data to the user.

### Service Layer:
contains the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the complex operations and orchestrates the interactions between different components of the application.

### Data Access Layer(Repository or DAO)
The data access layer is responsible for interacting with the underlying data storage, such as a database. It provides an abstraction over the persistence layer and offers methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data. Spring Boot provides various approaches for data access, such as Spring Data JPA, JDBC, or plain SQL queries. Repository interfaces are typically annotated with @Repository.

### Model Layer
The domain or model layer represents the business objects or entities in the application. It defines the structure and behavior of the data used in the application, including entity classes, value objects, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). These classes are often annotated with @Entity or @Component annotations.

### Infrastructure Layer
The infrastructure layer consists of components that provide low-level services to support the application's functionality. Examples include security configurations, external integrations, caching, logging, and messaging systems. These components are typically annotated with appropriate annotations like @Configuration, @Component, or specific infrastructure annotations.

## Q5 Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman.

When Postman calls an API, the request flows through the controller layer into the application. The controller handles the request and passes it to the service layer. The service layer performs the business logic and interacts with the data access layer. The data access layer is responsible for communication with the database. Once processing is complete, the service layer returns the result to the controller, which prepares an HTTP response and sends it back to Postman.

## Q6 What is the application.properties? do you know application.yml?
application.properties is a config file in Spring Boot, and application.yml is an alternative format. Both files are used to configure application properties.
