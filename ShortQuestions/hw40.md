1. see Doc annotations.md

2. Name's type is varchar(255) and 'John Snow' is given as the default value.
   studentName is mapped as student_name in database, and length is not longer than 50, could be duplicated but could not be null.

3. first_name, operating_system

4. Entity, Repository, Service, Controller. Role of each layer refers to annotations.md.

5. - Presentation Layer:
     Postman sends an HTTP request to the specified API endpoint.
     The request is received by the Spring Boot application's Controller class, which handles the incoming request.
   - Service Layer:
     The Controller delegates the request to a Service class.
     The Service class contains business logic and performs any necessary data processing or manipulation.
     It may interact with one or more Repository/DAO classes to retrieve or persist data.
   - Data Access Layer:
     The Service class interacts with the Repository/DAO classes to access data from a database or other data sources.
     The Repository/DAO classes are responsible for executing database queries and operations.
   - Persistence Layer:
     The Repository/DAO classes communicate with the underlying persistence mechanism, such as a relational database or NoSQL datastore.
     They handle data retrieval, storage, and management.
   - Presentation Layer (Response):
     After the Service layer completes the necessary operations, it returns the result to the Controller.
     The Controller prepares the response, which typically includes a response body, status code, and headers.
     The response is sent back to Postman as an HTTP response.

6. application.properties is a plain text file written in a key-value pair format.
   It is typically located in the src/main/resources directory of a Spring Boot project.
   It allows you to define and customize application-level properties.
   You can configure various settings, such as database connections, server ports, logging levels, and other Spring Boot-specific properties.
   Each line in the file represents a property in the format of key=value.
