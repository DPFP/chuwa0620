**2. explain how the below annotaitons specify the table in database?**
```
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")
private String name;
```
- columnDefinition: This attribute allows you to provide the SQL definition for the column. In this case, it specifies that the column is of type varchar(255) (a string with a maximum length of 255 characters) and has a default value of 'John Snow'.

```
@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName
```
This annotation is used to specify the properties of the studentName column in the table. Here's what each attribute means:
- name: This attribute specifies the actual column name in the database. In this case, the column name will be "STUDENT_NAME".
- length: This attribute specifies the maximum length of the column. In this case, the column can hold a maximum of 50 characters.
- nullable: This attribute specifies whether the column allows null values (false means it does not allow nulls).
- unique: This attribute specifies whether the column values must be unique (false means they don't have to be unique).

**3. What is the default column names of the table in database for  @Column?**
```
@Column
private String firstName;
@Column
private String operatingSystem;
```
first_name and operating_system

**4. What are the layers in springboot application? what is the role of each layer**
- Presentation Layer:
The presentation layer is responsible for handling the user interface and interaction. It focuses on presenting information to users and receiving input from them. In a Spring Boot application, the presentation layer is typically implemented using web frameworks like Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux. It handles HTTP requests, routes them to appropriate endpoints, and prepares data to be rendered in the user interface.

- Business Layer:
The business layer, also known as the service layer, contains the core business logic of the application. It encapsulates the operations and rules that govern the application's behavior. This layer is responsible for processing the data received from the presentation layer, applying business rules, and orchestrating interactions between different components. The business layer in a Spring Boot application is often implemented using Spring services or components.

- Persistence Layer:
The persistence layer is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of data from a database or any other data source. It interacts with the database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. In a Spring Boot application, the persistence layer is usually implemented using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like Hibernate or Spring Data JPA. These frameworks provide abstractions to map Java objects to database tables and simplify the interaction with the database.

- Database:
The database is where the actual data is stored. It is a separate system that persists and organizes the data in a structured manner. The database can be a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or an alternative such as a NoSQL database like MongoDB. The persistence layer interacts with the database to read or modify data based on the application's needs.

To summarize, the presentation layer handles the user interface and user interaction, the business layer contains the application's core logic, the persistence layer manages the interaction with the database, and the database itself is responsible for storing and retrieving the application's data. These layers work together to create a structured and modular architecture in a Spring Boot application.

**5. Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman.**
1. Presentation Layer:
Postman sends an HTTP request to the Spring Boot application.
The request is received by the web server embedded in Spring Boot, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty.
The web server forwards the request to the DispatcherServlet, which acts as the front controller for Spring MVC.

2. Business Layer:
The DispatcherServlet identifies the appropriate controller based on the URL mapping configured in the application.
The controller receives the request and processes it by invoking the relevant business logic.
The controller can access services or managers that encapsulate the business rules and perform operations such as data manipulation, validation, and orchestration.
The controller prepares the data to be sent back as a response.

3. Persistent Layer:
If the business logic involves accessing a database, the controller interacts with the persistence layer.
The persistence layer typically consists of data access objects (DAOs) or repositories that handle database operations.
The DAOs or repositories use technologies like Java Persistence API (JPA), Hibernate, or Spring Data JPA to communicate with the database.
The required data is retrieved from or persisted to the database through the persistence layer.

4. Database:
The persistence layer communicates with the database management system (DBMS).
The DBMS executes the SQL queries or statements received from the persistence layer.
The DBMS retrieves the requested data or performs the necessary database operations.
The DBMS sends the results back to the persistence layer.

5. Persistent Layer (continued):
The persistence layer receives the results from the database.
It may perform additional processing or mapping to transform the database results into suitable objects or data structures.
The processed data is returned to the controller in the business layer.

6. Business Layer (continued):
The controller receives the processed data from the persistence layer.
It can apply further business logic if required.
The controller prepares the final response, which typically includes the response body, headers, and status codes.

7. Presentation Layer (continued):
The prepared response is sent back to the DispatcherServlet.
The DispatcherServlet converts the response into an appropriate HTTP response format, such as JSON or XML.
The web server sends the formatted response back to Postman as an HTTP response.
Postman receives the response and displays it to the user.

**6. What is the application.properties? do you know application.yml?**
They are configuration files commonly used in Java-based applications, particularly those built with the Spring Framework.

- application.properties: It is a file that contains key-value pairs of configuration properties for an application. These properties can be used to customize various aspects of the application, such as database connection settings, logging configurations, server port, and other application-specific settings. The properties are typically defined in a simple key=value format, with one property per line.

- application.yml: It is an alternative configuration format to application.properties and is based on YAML syntax. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that uses indentation and colons to define key-value pairs. The application.yml file provides a more structured and hierarchical way of organizing configuration properties compared to the flat structure of application.properties. It allows the use of lists, maps, and complex objects in the configuration.

Both application.properties and application.yml serve the same purpose of providing configurable properties for an application. The choice between them depends on personal preference or the specific requirements of the project. Some developers find YAML easier to read and write, especially for complex configurations, while others prefer the simplicity of the properties file. In Spring Boot applications, both formats are supported, and you can choose the one that suits your needs best.
