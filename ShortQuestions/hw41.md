## Q2 how do you do the debug?
Checking the erro message and print some logs to locate the bug and solve it.

## Q3 What is DTO, VO, Payload, DO, model?
DTO: Data Transfer Object, DTO is a design pattern used to transfer data between different layers or components of an application.

VO: Value Object, VO is another design pattern that represents an immutable object that encapsulates values or attributes. Unlike DTO, which focus on data transfer, VO is used to represent domain-specific values that have intrinsic meaning within the application's business logic.

Payload: Referring the data that is transmitted over a network or passed between components such as JSON or XML.

DO: Domain Object, represents an object that is part of the application's domain model. It encapsulates the behavior and state related to a specific domain concept or entity.

Model: representing the structure and relationships of the data in database.

## Q4 What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds")
It is typically used in Java frameworks, such as Jackson or Gson, to specify the mapping between a JSON property and a corresponding Java object's property during serialization and deserialization.


## Q5 do you know what is jackson?
It is a library for processing JSON data.

## Q6 What is spring-boot-stater? What dependecies in the below starter? do you know any startersï¼Ÿ
```XML
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
The spring-boot-starter is a convenient way to include a set of dependencies in the project with a single Maven or Gradle dependency declaration.

It include: spring-boot-starter, sspring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-json, spring-boot-starter-tomcat

## Q7 do you know  @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST) ? could you list CRUD by this style?
```Java
@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{userId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{userId}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{userId}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
```

## Q8 What is ResponseEntity? why do we need it?
```Java
new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, HttpStatus.OK);
new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, 
HttpStatus.CREATED);
ResponseEntity.ok(postService.getPostById(id));
```
It can be used to construct HTTP response.

## Q9 What is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC?
ResultSet represents the result of executing a SQL query against a database. It provides methods to navigate through the result set and retrieve the data returned by the query.

1. Import the necessary JDBC classes
2. Load the JDBC driver and establish a connection to the database
3. Create a statement object to execute the SQL query
4. Execute the SQL query and obtain a ResultSet
5. Iterate over the ResultSet to retrieve the data
6. Close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects.

## Q10 What is the ORM framework?
ORM, Object-Relational Mapping framework is a software library or tool that facilitates the interaction between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language.

## Q12 What is the serialization and desrialization?
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as a byte stream, a string or JSON.
Deserialization is the process of reconstructing an object from its serializaed form, it is the reverse process of serialization, where the serialized representation is converted back into a usable object.

## Q13 use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32]
```Java
int[] arr = {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
double avg = Arrays.stream(arr)
        .average()
        .orElse(0.0);
```
