DTO: Data Transfer Object is a design pattern used to transfer data between different layers or components of an application. 

VO: Value Object is another design pattern used to represent an immutable object that carries values or attributes.

Payload: The term "payload" is often used to refer to the actual data being carried or transmitted within a message or a container.

DO: Domain Object, represents an object that is part of the domain model in domain-driven design (DDD). 

Model: A data model is a conceptual representation of how data is organized, stored, and related within a system. It defines the structure, integrity constraints, and relationships between different data elements.

@JsonProperty("description_yyds) will give the name "description_yyds" to the field it applies to instead of using the default name.

Jackson is a popular open-source Java library for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) processing. It provides a set of APIs for reading, writing, and manipulating JSON data in Java. Jackson aims to provide efficient and flexible JSON processing capabilities, making it easier to work with JSON data in Java applications.

In the context of the Spring Framework, "spring-boot-starter" refers to a set of dependencies bundled together as a starter package. 

### 6.a
spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, spring-boot-starter-security

Yes, but it is an outdated writing style.

```
@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
```

ResponseEntity is a class provided by the Spring Framework that represents the entire HTTP response, including the response body, headers, and status code. It is used to build and customize the HTTP response that will be sent back to the client from a controller method in a Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application.

By using ResponseEntity, programmers have more control and flexibility in shaping the HTTP response returned by API endpoints. It helps in building robust and standards-compliant APIs, providing meaningful responses to clients, and handling various use cases and scenarios effectively.

ResultSet represents the result of executing a database query. It is a tabular data structure that contains the data returned by the database in response to a query. 

1. establish a connection
2. create a prepared statement or query
3. execute the query
4. looping through the result set to get the objects
5. close the connection

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique and framework that allows developers to map object-oriented models to relational databases. It bridges the gap between the object-oriented programming paradigm used in application development and the relational database model used for data storage.

Done.

Serialization is the process of converting a data object—a combination of code and data represented within a region of data storage—into a series of bytes that saves the state of the object in an easily transmittable form. In this serialized form, the data can be delivered to another data store.

The reverse process—constructing a data structure or object from a series of bytes—is deserialization. The deserialization process recreates the object, thus making the data easier to read and modify as a native structure in a programming language.

```
int[] array = new int[]{20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
double ave = Arrays.stream(array).average().orElse(0.0);
```
