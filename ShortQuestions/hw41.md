   DTO (Data Transfer Object): A DTO is a data container used for transferring specific data between different layers or components of an application, facilitating decoupling and minimizing data transmitted over the network.

   VO (Value Object): VO represents a simple, immutable entity without a unique identity, encapsulating small pieces of data used for specific operations.

   Payload: Payload refers to the actual data transmitted over a network, typically in JSON, XML, or binary format, carrying information between client and server in API requests or responses.

   DO (Domain Object): DO represents core business entities in an application, residing in the domain layer and responsible for implementing business logic and rules.

   Model: The Model is a data structure or class holding data and behavior, often representing real-world entities, and used for managing data and defining operations related to that data in an application.

4. When you serialize an instance of MyClass to JSON, the property named description will be mapped to a JSON field named "description_yyds". Similarly, when deserializing JSON data with a field named "description_yyds", it will be mapped to the description property of the Java object. This way, you can customize the mapping between Java class properties and JSON fields as needed.

5. Jackson is a popular Java library used for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data processing, including serialization and deserialization. It provides a set of APIs that allow you to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa, making it easy to work with JSON data in Java applications.

6. A Spring Boot Starter is a special dependency in the Spring Boot framework designed to simplify and expedite the process of building Spring Boot applications. Starters are pre-configured dependencies and configurations that can be easily included to enable specific functionalities or integrate with third-party libraries without manually configuring extensive XML or Java code.

7. The path is /users and request method is POST, this will create a user.

8. ResponseEntity enables developer to append some other meta data to the response.

9. In JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), a ResultSet is an interface that represents the result set of a database query. It provides methods to access and retrieve the data returned by the query from the database. When you execute a SELECT query using JDBC, the result of that query is returned as a ResultSet object.

10. ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that allows you to interact with a relational database using object-oriented paradigms. The primary goal of an ORM framework is to bridge the gap between the object-oriented world of programming languages and the relational world of databases.

12. Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a specific format (usually a byte stream or a string) for transmission or storage, allowing it to be reconstructed or restored back into its original form when needed. Deserialization, on the other hand, is the process of converting the serialized data (usually a byte stream or a string) back into its original data structure or object, enabling its utilization and manipulation in a programming environment.

13. ```
    import java.util.Arrays;
    import java.util.List;

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(0, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32);

            double average = numbers.stream()
                    .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                    .average()
                    .orElse(0.0);

            System.out.println("List的平均值为: " + average);
        }
    }
    ```
