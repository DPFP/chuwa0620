1. Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is the top layer of the spring boot architecture. It consists of Views. i.e., the front-end part of the application. It handles the HTTP requests and performs authentication. It is responsible for converting the JSON fieldâ€™s parameter to Java Objects and vice-versa. Once it performs the authentication of the request it passes it to the next layer. i.e., the business layer.

2. Business Layer
The business layer contains all the business logic. It consists of services classes. It is responsible for validation and authorization.

The persistence layer contains all the database storage logic. It is responsible for converting business objects to the database row and vice-versa.

The database layer contains all the databases such as MySql, MongoDB, etc. This layer can contain multiple databases. It is responsible for performing the CRUD operations.
