## Q2 what is selenium?
Selenium is a browser automation tool.
## Q3 what is cucumber?
Cucumber is a tool for behavior-driven development (BDD) that allows you to write executable specifications in plain text.
## Q4 what is JMeter?
JMeter is a performance testing tool used for analyzing and measuring the performance of applications and services.
## Q5 What is the lifecircle of Junit?
The lifecycle of JUnit involves four main steps: @Before, @Test, @After, and @AfterClass. These annotations define setup, test execution, teardown, and cleanup actions for test cases.
## Q6 Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes, it should be a static method at the class level.
## Q7 What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?
Mockito is a Java testing framework used to create mock objects for unit testing. Its limitations include difficulty in mocking final classes/methods and complex static methods. Tools like PowerMock can help overcome these limitations by extending Mockito's capabilities.
## Q8 What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
@Mock is an annotation used in test classes to create mock objects, typically used to simulate dependencies. 

@InjectMocks is an annotation used to inject mock objects into the object being tested, automatically providing the mock dependencies during unit testing.
## Q9 What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
Stubbing is the process of defining predetermined behaviors for methods or functions in mock objects during testing. It specifies how a method should respond when called with specific inputs, allowing controlled simulation of dependencies' behavior.
## Q10 what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
Mockito ArgumentMatchers is a utility class in the Mockito framework that provides methods for defining argument matchers when stubbing or verifying method calls on mock objects. It helps in specifying flexible conditions for method call parameters during testing.
## Q11 what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest Matchers are a set of assertion and matching methods provided by the Hamcrest library, used in various testing frameworks including JUnit and Mockito. They enable expressive and flexible assertions in unit tests by allowing you to create readable and understandable match conditions for expected values.
## Q12 do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
@Spy is used in testing frameworks like Mockito to create a partially real object. It retains the original behavior of the object's methods while allowing you to stub or verify specific method calls.

The difference between @Spy and @Mock is that @Spy maintains the real behavior of the object, invoking actual methods unless overridden, while @Mock creates a completely mocked version of the object, replacing all method behaviors with stubs.
## Q13 What is assertion?
Assertion is a mechanism in software testing where you check if a specific condition or expectation holds true in your code. It helps ensure the correctness of your program by verifying that the actual outcomes match the expected ones during testing.
## Q14 If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?
1. Unit Testing: Verify the correctness of individual components
2. Integration Testing: Verify that the collaboration between components or modules is correct
3. Regression Testing: Ensure that after changes, existing functionality is still correct
4. Performance Testing: Verify the performance and efficiency of the system
5. Stress Testing: Ensure that the system can still work normally under high pressure
6. User Acceptance Testing: Ensure that the software meets user needs and expectations

Unit Testing, Integration Testing and Regression Testing should be written by me.
