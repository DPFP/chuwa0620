## 2.  what is selenium?
```
Selenium is an open-source software framework commonly used for automating web browsers.
```

## 3.  what is cucumber?
```
Cucumber is a tool for behavior-driven development (BDD) that allows you to write executable specifications in plain text.
```

## 4.  what is JMeter?
```
JMeter is a performance testing tool used for analyzing and measuring the performance of applications and services.
```

## 5.  What is the lifecircle of Junit?
```
@BeforeAll -> @BeforeEach -> @Test -> @AfterEach -> @AfterAll
```

## 6.  Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
```
Yes, it should be a static method at the class level.
```

## 7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?
```
Mockito is a popular open-source Java library used for mocking objects in unit testing.
limitations is that it's hard to mock final classes/methods and complex static methods.
 This could be fixed by using PowerMock. PowerMock is an extension of Mockito that can mock final classes and static methods, overcoming one of Mockito's limitations
```

## 8.  What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
```
@Mock is an annotation used in test classes to create mock objects, typically used to simulate dependencies. 
@InjectMocks is an annotation used to inject mock objects into the object being tested, automatically providing the mock dependencies during unit testing.
```

## 9.  What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
```
Stubbing, like mocking, means creating a stand-in, but a stub only mocks the behavior, but not the entire object. This is used when your implementation only interacts with a certain behavior of the object.
```

## 10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
```
Argument matchers are mainly used for performing flexible verification and stubbing in Mockito. 
Some common Mockito ArgumentMatchers include:'any()','eq()','isNull()','anyVararg()'.
```

## 11. what is Hamcrest Matchers
```
Hamcrest Matchers are a set of assertion and matching methods provided by the Hamcrest library, used in various testing frameworks including JUnit and Mockito.
```

## 12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
```
@Spy is used in testing frameworks like Mockito to create a partially real object. It retains the original behavior of the object's methods while allowing you to stub or verify specific method calls.
@spy use real method invokation and @Mock do not
```

## 13. What is assertion?
```
Assertion is a mechanism in software testing where you check if a specific condition or expectation holds true in your code
```

## 14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?
```
1. Unit tests: focus on testing individual units or components of the feature in isolation
2. Integration tests: verify that different components or units of the feature work together correctly when integrated
3. Regression tests: ensure that the new feature has not introduced any unintended side effects or broken existing functionality.
4. Performance/Load tests: help identify performance bottlenecks and ensure that the feature can handle the expected user load
5. A/B Test: gather valuable feedback from users before the official launch
6. Stress Testing: Ensure that the system can still work normally under high pressure
7. User Acceptance Testing: Ensure that the software meets user needs and expectations
```

## 15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%
