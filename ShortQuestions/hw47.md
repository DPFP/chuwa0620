Selenium is an open-source suite of tools designed to automate web browsers. It allows developers and testers to interact with web applications in a way that replicates human interactions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating through pages, and extracting data. 

## 3
Cucumber is an open-source software tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD). It facilitates collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders by allowing them to describe application behavior in a human-readable format. 

## 4
It is primarily used for load testing, stress testing, and performance testing of web applications and other server-based applications.

Mockito is an open-source Java mocking framework used for unit testing. It allows developers to create mock objects to simulate the behavior of dependencies and focus on testing the behavior of the class under test in isolation. 

It cannot mock final static or private methods.

PowerMockito.

The @Mock annotation is used to create mock objects for classes or interfaces. When you annotate a field with @Mock, Mockito automatically initializes the field as a mock object, and you can use it in your test methods. The mock object behaves like a real object but does not perform any actual operations. Instead, you define the behavior of the mock object using Mockito's API, such as specifying return values for its methods.

The @InjectMocks annotation is used to inject the mock objects created with @Mock into the instance of the class under test. When you annotate a field with @InjectMocks, Mockito will try to inject the mock objects into this field by matching their types with the fields or constructor parameters of the class under test.

In other words, stubbing allows you to set up the responses of the mock object's methods, defining what values they should return or what actions they should perform when called with specific arguments.

## 10
Mockito's ArgumentMatchers help you define flexible argument matching conditions, allowing you to stub method calls or verify method invocations with different argument constraints.

## 11
Hamcrest provides a collection of flexible and expressive matchers that allow you to create readable and maintainable test assertions. 

## 12
@Spy is used to create a partial mock of a real object. Unlike @Mock, which creates a completely new mock object with all methods having default behavior, @Spy allows you to wrap an existing object and selectively mock specific methods while retaining the real behavior of the non-mocked methods.

## 13
An assertion, in the context of software testing, is a statement or expression that checks whether a given condition or expectation is true or false.

## 14
Unit Test: Testing the smallest testable units of a program, such as functions or methods.
Purpose: Verify the correctness of individual components

Integration Test: Testing the interactions between multiple components or modules.
Purpose: Verify that the collaboration between components or modules is correct.

Regression Test: After modifying the program or environment, re-run previously run tests to confirm that no new errors have been introduced.
Purpose: Ensure that after changes, existing functionality is still correct.
