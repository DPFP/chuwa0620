### 2 what is selenium?
Selenium is used for automating web applications for testing purposes, it simulates the user behaviors such as clicking, sliding, log in, fill out forms, etc

### 3 what is cucumber?
Cucumber is also one of the software testing process in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. It starts with simple natual language that anyone can understand and therefore make the testing process more intuitive and easy to understand even if the people reading it are not technical experts.

### 4 what is JMeter?
JMeter is an open-source source software that can analyze and measure the performance of the application or a variety of services.

### 5 What is the lifecircle of Junit?
A lifecycle method is any method that is annotated with @BeforeAll , @AfterAll , @BeforeEach or @AfterEach annotation. The lifecycle methods execute before or after executing the actual test methods.

### 6 Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes, @BeforeAll should annotate static method, therefore the method is class level

### 7 What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?
Mockito is a Java-based framework used for unit testing of Java applications. This mocking framework helps in the development of testable applications. You use Java Reflection API internally to generate mock objects.  
It can not mock static methods. Classes, constructors and private methods can not be mocked. We can use PowerMockito.
### 8 What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
A mock is a fake class that can be examined after the test is finished for its interactions with the class under test.  
@InjectMock creates an instance of the class and injects the mocks that are marked with the annotations @Mock into it.

### 9 What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
A stub method is a method that just returns a simple but valid (though not necessarily correct) result.

### 10 what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
ArgumentMatchers allow us flexible verification or stubbing. If a method has more than one argument, we can't just use ArgumentMatchers for only some of the arguments. Mockito requires that we provide all arguments either by matchers or exact values.

### 11 what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. 

### 12 do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
@spy: is a partial mock object that mock part of the object
@Mock: is a normal mock object that allows you to stub invocations

### 13 What is assertion?
An assertion is a statement in the Java programming language that enables you to test your assumptions about your program. 

### 14 If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?
Unit Testing: Verify the correctness of individual components  
Integration Testing: Verify that the collaboration between components or modules is correct  
Functional Testing: Verify that the function meets the expected requirements  
Regression Testing: Ensure that after changes, existing functionality is still correct
Performance Testing: Verify the performance and efficiency of the system  

### 15 Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.
