# 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that separates cross-cutting concerns from the core logic by using aspects to encapsulate and apply the behavior to specific points in the code. It improves code modularity and makes it easier to manage complex applications.

# 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
**Advantage:**
- Improves modularity and reusability
- Reduced code duplication
- Easy integration
- Provides runtime flexibility

**Disadvantage:**
- Introduced apect ordering complexity
- Increased debugging complexity
- Dependent on Spring Framework

# 5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect in Spring AOP is a modular unit that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. It is a way of grouping related advice and pointcut expressions that define where and when the behavior should be applied in the application's code. 

# 6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
Pointcut expressions use patterns to select the join points where the advice associated with an aspect should be applied. It allows you to specify which parts of the code are affected by the aspect's behavior.

# 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A join point in Spring AOP is a specific point in the program's execution where an aspect can be applied. It represents the moment when the control flow passes through the code at a specific point.

# 8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
An "advice" refers to the actual behavior that gets executed at a specific join point in the application's code. It represents the cross-cutting concern encapsulated within an aspect. 

# 10. When to use Spring Batch?
- Data Processing and Transformation
- Scheduled Data Jobs
- Long-Running Tasks

# 11. How Spring Batch works?
1. ItemReader: Reads data from a data source, such as files, databases, or other external systems. It produces chunks of data to be processed.

2. ItemProcessor: Optionally, processes the data read by the ItemReader. It applies business logic or transformations to the data before passing it to the ItemWriter.

3. ItemWriter: Writes the processed data to the desired destination, such as databases, files, or other systems.

4. Listeners: Spring Batch provides listeners that allow you to hook into the different phases of the batch job to perform additional actions.

# 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
1. Annotate Spring Batch job with @Configuration to make it a Spring bean.

2. Define a method to launch the Spring Batch job.

3. Use the scheduling mechanism to call the method that launches the job at a specific time or interval.

# 13. What is the cron expression?
A cron expression is a string format used to define the schedule for recurring tasks in a time-based job scheduling system. 

# 14. What is the spring task?
It allows you to schedule and execute tasks (methods) at specific intervals or fixed times.

# 15. When to use Spring task?
Spring Task is used in scenarios where you need to execute certain tasks periodically or at fixed intervals in your Spring application. Such as scheduled data processing, cron jobs, periodic reports and notifications.

# 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
A filter refers to a component that intercepts and modifies HTTP requests and responses in a web application. 

# 17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
An "interceptor" is a design pattern used to capture and handle requests and responses flowing through the application. Interceptors intercept HTTP requests and responses before and after they reach the controller or view, allowing developers to perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks.

# 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
preHandle: It allows you to perform pre-processing tasks before the controller's logic is executed.

postHandle: Called after the controller's method is invoked but before the view is rendered.

# 19. What is Swagger?
Swagger is an open-source framework that simplifies the process of designing, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. It provides a suite of tools to generate interactive and machine-readable API documentation, which makes it easier for developers to understand and use APIs without inspecting the source code directly.
