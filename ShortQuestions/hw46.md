### 3 What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is an approach to programming that allows global properties of a program to determine how it is compiled into an executable program.

### 4 What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
It addresses the problem of cross-cutting concerns, which will be any kind of code that is repeated in different methods and can't normally be refactored into own module.

### 5 What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
Pros:  
- Make code more modularized
- Reduce coupling of dependencies
- Make code more repeatable and maintainable
Cons:
- AOP needs libraries to function
- Debugging could be difficult since more coded needs to be meets the standards

### 6 What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
PointCut: expression to find all main application methods to insert advice
Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.

### 7 What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values, etc. In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method. 

### 8 What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application.  
- @Before – Run before the method execution @After – Run after the method returned a result
- @AfterReturning – Run after the method returned a result, intercept the returned result as well.
- @AfterThrowing – Run after the method throws an exception
- @Around – Run around the method execution, combine all three advices above.
- @Aspect - indicate this is a aop class
- @Component - This annotation mark the beans as Spring’s managed components

### 10 When to use Spring Batch?
- Download the data from an external database via the REST API and save them as CSV files.
- Each data set is independent, so steps in jobs also have to be independent (with one exception).
- Create as many MongoDB collections as CSV files.
- Convert each row from a CSV file to a MongoDB document.

### 11 How Spring Batch works?
It follows the traditional batch architecture. A job can have more than one stop, and every step typically follows the sequence of reading data, processing it and writing it.

### 12 How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
1. Using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
2. Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job execution logic inside this method.

### 13 What is the cron expression?
A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven subexpressions (fields) that describe individual details of the schedule. 

### 14 What is the spring task?
It's a lightweight timed execution tools that can run a task in a set time period with specified frequency

### 15 When to use Spring task?
You use Spring task when you want your software to perform some timed task, for example: data backup, count down for order, crawling web data, push news feed and notification, post article at a certian time.

### 16 What is Filter and any filter example?
Filter is used to intercept the client request and do some pre-processing. It can also intercept the response and do post-processing before sending to the client in web application.
- Authentication Filters
- Logging and Auditing Filters
- Image conversion Filters

### 17 What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
Spring boot interceptor is defined as a concept that is invoked at the time of preprocessing and post-processing of a request and allows the only filtered request to the controllers to process it.  
- log in verification
- authorization check
- handling cookie

### 18 In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
preHandle will be executed before the Controller method is executed.  
postHandle will be executed after the Controller method is executed.

### 19 What is Swagger?
Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger framework allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation.
