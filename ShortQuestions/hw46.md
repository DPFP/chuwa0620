Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm and a software design approach that aims to modularize cross-cutting concerns in a system.

## 4
Advantages:

Modularity: AOP allows concerns to be separated into distinct modules, promoting better organization and maintenance.

Reusability: Aspects are reusable components, making it easier to apply the same concern to multiple parts of the codebase.

Better Encapsulation: Business logic can focus on core functionality, while cross-cutting concerns are encapsulated in aspects.

Reduced Code Duplication: AOP helps eliminate code duplication by centralizing cross-cutting concerns in aspects.

Improved Readability: By isolating cross-cutting concerns, the core business logic becomes easier to read and understand.

Disadvantages:
Testing and debugging, Potential Performance Overhead

## 5
Aspect: An aspect is a modular unit that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns. It is a reusable component that can be applied across different parts of the codebase. Examples of aspects include logging, security, caching, and error handling.

## 6
Pointcut: A pointcut is an expression that defines which join points in the codebase will be affected by a particular aspect. It helps in specifying where the advice should be applied.

## 7
Join Point: A join point is a specific point in the execution flow of the program, such as method calls, method execution, or exception handling. Aspects are applied at specific join points.

## 8
Advice: An advice is the actual implementation of what should be done at a specific join point. It represents the code that gets executed when the aspect is applied to a particular join point. There are different types of advice, including "before," "after," "around," "after-returning," and "after-throwing."

Spring Batch is a powerful framework provided by the Spring ecosystem for processing large volumes of data efficiently in batch jobs. It is designed to handle complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive tasks that are not suitable for real-time processing.

e.g: scheduled jobs, Data Processing and ETL

## 11
Job: A job is the top-level unit in Spring Batch. It represents a complete batch process, which can consist of one or more steps. A job is defined using the Job interface or by using XML configuration.

Step: A step is a self-contained unit of work within a job. Each step has a specific task to perform, such as reading data, processing data, or writing data. A job can have one or more steps, and each step can be configured with various processors, writers, and listeners.

When you run a Spring Batch job, the job execution follows the defined steps, with each step executing in sequence. The framework manages the transactional behavior, restartability, and error handling, providing a reliable and robust batch processing solution.

## 12
Using Spring's @Scheduled Annotation

## 13
A cron expression is a string that defines the schedule for running a task at fixed intervals using the cron syntax. Cron expressions consist of five or six fields separated by whitespace or tabs, representing different time units.

## 14
In Spring, a "task" generally refers to a piece of work or a job that needs to be executed asynchronously or at a scheduled time. Spring provides several mechanisms to handle tasks efficiently, such as Spring's TaskExecutor and the @Scheduled annotation.

## 15
Use these features based on your specific requirements for executing tasks in the background, improving performance, or automating periodic tasks in your Spring applications.

## 16
In Spring, a filter is a component that intercepts and processes incoming HTTP requests and outgoing HTTP responses before they reach the servlet or after they have been processed by the servlet. Filters are used for pre-processing and post-processing of requests and responses, making them useful for various tasks, such as logging, authentication, authorization, compression, and more.

## 17
In Spring, an interceptor is an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) mechanism that allows you to intercept and modify the processing of HTTP requests and responses in a Spring MVC application. Interceptors are specific to the Spring Web MVC framework and work at a higher level than filters. They provide a way to pre-process requests before they reach the controller, post-process responses before they are sent to the client, or perform other tasks around the handler execution.

## 18
preHandle: This method is called before the actual handler (controller method) is invoked. It allows you to perform pre-processing tasks, such as authentication, logging, or auditing. You can also decide whether to continue or stop the request processing by returning true or false, respectively.

postHandle: This method is called after the handler has been invoked but before the view is rendered. It allows you to perform post-processing tasks on the model or view. You can modify the model attributes or add additional attributes that will be available in the view.

Swagger is an open-source software framework that provides tools for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. It allows developers to create interactive API documentation, making it easier for both developers and non-developers to understand and interact with APIs. Swagger provides a set of tools and specifications that enable the generation of API documentation in a standardized and machine-readable format.
