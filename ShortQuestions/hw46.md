## Q3 What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows modularizing cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management, by separating them from the main business logic. AOP helps to achieve better code organization and promotes reusability and maintainability in software development.
## Q4 What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages:
1. Modularity: Allows separation of cross-cutting concerns from business logic, leading to more organized code.
2. Reusability: Aspect components can be reused across different parts of the application.
3. Maintainability: Easier to maintain and update aspects independently without affecting core business logic.
4. Encapsulation: Keeps concerns isolated, improving code readability and comprehensibility.
   
Disadvantages:
1. Limited Scope: AOP is best suited for certain types of cross-cutting concerns and may not be ideal for all scenarios.
2. Runtime Overhead: Introducing aspects can add some runtime overhead to the application.
3. Complexity: Understanding and debugging AOP can be challenging, especially for complex aspects and interactions.
4. Learning Curve: Developers need to learn AOP concepts and annotations, which can increase the learning curve.
## Q5 What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect is a module that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns. It defines the behavior that needs to be applied across multiple points in the application, such as logging, security, or transaction management. Aspects are combined with the main business logic to achieve modularity and separation of concerns.
## Q6 What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
A pointcut is an expression that defines the specific join points in the application where an aspect's advice should be applied. It helps to identify the methods or locations in the codebase where the cross-cutting concerns will be executed.
## Q7 What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A join point is a specific point in the program's execution where an aspect's advice can be applied. It represents the methods or points in the codebase where cross-cutting concerns can be weaved in, such as before, after, or around method calls.
## Q8 What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
Advice refers to the actions taken at specific join points in the application.  
1. Before Advice
2. After Returning Advice
3. After Throwing Advice
4. After (Finally) Advice
5. Around Advice
## Q10 When to use Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is used when you need to process large volumes of data efficiently and reliably, especially in batch processing scenarios. It provides a robust framework for defining and executing complex, repeatable, and scheduled batch jobs. Spring Batch is suitable for tasks like data import/export, report generation, data cleansing, and other batch processing tasks that require fault-tolerance, scalability, and transaction management.
## Q11 How Spring Batch works?
Spring Batch works by defining batch jobs using Spring configuration and Java code.

## Q12 How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
1. Spring Boot's @Scheduled: Use the @Scheduled annotation to define a cron expression or fixed rate/interval to trigger the job at specific times.
2. Spring TaskScheduler: Use Spring's TaskScheduler to schedule the job programmatically in your application.
3. Quartz Scheduler: Integrate with the Quartz scheduler to schedule the Spring Batch job based on cron expressions or triggers.
4. External Job Scheduler: Use external job schedulers like Cron or Jenkins to trigger the Spring Batch job at specified intervals.
## Q13 What is the cron expression?
Cron expression is a string representing a schedule in the form of "minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week". It is used to define the specific time and frequency at which a task or job should be executed.
## Q14 What is the spring task?
It is a feature provided by the Spring Framework to manage asynchronous tasks and schedule jobs. It allows you to execute methods asynchronously, run tasks at fixed intervals or specific times, and manage background processing efficiently. Spring Task is useful for handling non-blocking operations, periodic tasks, and scheduling batch jobs.
## Q15 When to use Spring task? 
You can use Spring Task when you need to perform asynchronous operations, schedule tasks, or manage background processing in your application. It is suitable for scenarios such as handling non-blocking tasks, periodic jobs, batch processing, and managing long-running processes in a scalable and efficient manner.
## Q16 What is Filter and any filter example?
A filter in the context of web applications is a component used to intercept and process HTTP requests and responses. It allows you to perform pre-processing before a request reaches the servlet or post-processing after the servlet response is generated.

Example of a filter: The logging filter, which logs information about incoming requests, can be used to track request details like URI, method, and timestamp. It helps in monitoring and debugging the application's HTTP traffic.
## Q17 What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
An interceptor is a component in web applications that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses like filters.
## Q18 In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
preHandle: It is a method that is executed before the controller's method is invoked. It allows you to perform operations or checks before the actual handling of the request. For example, you can use it for logging, authentication, or request validation.

postHandle: It is a method that is executed after the controller's method is invoked but before the view is rendered. It allows you to modify the model or view before sending the response to the client. For example, you can add additional attributes to the model or perform post-processing on the view.
## Q19 What is Swagger?
Swagger is an open-source toolset that enables developers to design, document, and consume RESTful APIs easily.
