## 3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
```
aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation 
of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself,
 instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification, such as "log all function calls when the function's name begins with 'set'"
```

## 4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
```
advantage:
- easy to config
- utilize Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
- can use @AspectJ annotation for aspect creation

disadvantage:
- debug will be challenging
- only methods with a public visibility will be recommended
```

## 5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
```
It is a combination of advice and pointcuts.
```

## 6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
```
an expression that chooses one or more join points at which advice is given.
```

## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
```
a place in the application where an AOP aspect is applied.
```

## 8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
```
an action which we take before or after the method execution. It could be @Before, @After, @AfteThrowing, @AfterReturnning, @Arounding
```


## 10. When to use Spring Batch?
```
For large scale of data usage such as: data transformation, paralled processing, long running tasks.
```

## 11. How Spring Batch works?
```
-started by the job launcher, it will link a job to be executed and a JobRepository to store metadata.
-A Job is a whole process that need to be executed, it inlcude mulitple steps. 
-A step is an independent small piece of job, and made up of a ItemReader, ItemProcessor, ItemWritter, 
which are used to read in data, transform and process data, and output data.
-Metadata of the running job will be store in the JobRepository which provide CRUD operation for JobLauncher, Job and Step.

```

## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
```
use Spring's built-in @Scheduled annotation in conjunction with a JobLauncher.
@Scheduled(cron = "0 * * * * ?")
public void runSpringBatchJob() {
    XXXX
}
```

## 13. What is the cron expression?
```
A cron expression is a string that represents a schedule in the Unix cron syntax. This format is used by many Unix-like operating systems for job scheduling.
```

## 14. What is the spring task?
```
Spring Task is a part of the Spring Framework that provides support for task scheduling and asynchronous method execution.
Example:
@Component
public class ScheduledTasks {
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000)
    public void doSomething() {
        // this code will be executed every 5 seconds
    }
}
```

## 15. When to use Spring task?
```
When scheduling of tasks is needed
```

## 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
```
a filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource, or on the response from a resource, or both. It's a part of the Java Servlet specification and can be used in any Java web application.
Example:
public class MyFilter implements Filter{  
  
public void init(FilterConfig arg0) throws ServletException {}  
      
public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse resp,  
    FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {  
          
    PrintWriter out=resp.getWriter();  
    out.print("filter is invoked before");  
          
    chain.doFilter(req, resp);//sends request to next resource  
          
    out.print("filter is invoked after");  
    }  
    public void destroy() {}  
}  
```

## 17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
```
Spring Interceptor are used to intercept client requests and process them. Sometimes we want to intercept the HTTP 
Request and do some processing before handing it over to the controller handler methods.

-preHandle():It can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, or modifying the request. It can also short-circuit the request and return a response immediately by returning false.

-postHandle(): after the handler is executed and before the view is rendered. It can be used for tasks like adding additional attributes to the model.

-afterCompletion(): We can use this method to obtain request and response data after the view is rendered:
```

## 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
```
-preHandle():It can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, or modifying the request. It can also short-circuit the request and return a response immediately by returning false.

-postHandle(): after the handler is executed and before the view is rendered. It can be used for tasks like adding additional attributes to the model.
```

## 19. What is Swagger?
```
Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.
-Swagger Editor – browser-based editor where you can write OpenAPI definitions.
-Swagger UI – renders OpenAPI definitions as interactive documentation.
-Swagger Codegen – generates server stubs and client libraries from an OpenAPI definition.
-Swagger Editor Next (beta) – browser-based editor where you can write and review OpenAPI and AsyncAPI definitions.
-Swagger Core – Java-related libraries for creating, consuming, and working with OpenAPI definitions.
-Swagger Parser – standalone library for parsing OpenAPI definitions
-Swagger APIDom – provides a single, unifying structure for describing APIs across various description languages and serialization formats.
```
