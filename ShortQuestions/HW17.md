7. **Distributed Tracing**: Tools like Jaeger or Zipkin for tracing requests across services.
8. **Containers and Orchestration**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration.
9. **Security**: Implementing OAuth, JWT for authentication and authorization.
10. **Message Brokers**: Tools like Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.
11. **Databases**: Various databases, depending on the service needs.

#### What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

Resilience patterns help applications recover from failures, maintaining functionality and performance.

Circuit Breaker

A Circuit Breaker is a design pattern used in modern software development. It's particularly useful in a microservices environment where different services have dependencies on each other.

- **Closed State**: Requests flow through as usual.
- **Open State**: If failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit breaker "trips" to an open state. Requests are not sent to the failing service, and fallback actions are taken.
- **Half-Open State**: After a timeout, the circuit allows a limited number of requests to pass through to test if the underlying issue has been resolved.

The circuit breaker pattern prevents a failure in one service from cascading to other services, thus maintaining the resilience and stability of the entire system. Libraries like Hystrix or Resilience4j can be used to implement this pattern in various programming languages.

#### How to do service discovery?

Service discovery helps clients find the location of services within a distributed environment. In a microservices architecture, it can be achieved through tools like Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes service discovery, which register services and allow clients to query their locations.

#### What are the major components of Kafka?

- **Producer**: Sends messages to Kafka topics.
- **Consumer**: Reads messages from topics.
- **Brokers**: Kafka servers that store data and serve clients.
- **ZooKeeper**: Manages broker metadata.
- **Topics**: Categories to which messages are sent.
- **Partitions**: Segments within topics for parallelism.

#### What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?

A partition in Kafka is a smaller division of a topic. It allows for parallelism as different consumers can read different partitions simultaneously.

#### What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?

ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service used by Kafka to manage broker metadata, leader election, and configuration. It ensures that the Kafka cluster's state is consistent.

#### Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?

Current: Yes
Before: No

#### Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.

- **Leader**: The broker responsible for all reads and writes for a given partition.
- **Follower**: Other brokers that replicate the leader's data. They serve as backups.

#### Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?

- **Topic Replication**: Important for fault tolerance. Copies data across multiple brokers.
- **ISR (In-Sync Replicas)**: The set of replicas containing up-to-date data. Ensures data integrity.

#### What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?

A consumer group is a set of consumers working together to consume data from one or more topics. Allows for horizontal scaling and load balancing.

#### How do you start a Kafka server?

Typically involves launching ZooKeeper, then starting the Kafka broker with a configuration file. Commands can be like:

```
codebin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

#### Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka.

Kafka is used in real-time analytics, monitoring, data lakes, aggregating data from different sources, and acting as a buffer to handle burst data loads.

#### Describe partitioning key in Kafka.

A partitioning key is used by a producer to determine which partition a particular message will be sent to within a topic.

#### What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka?

Partitions allow for horizontal scalability, enabling multiple consumers to read from a topic in parallel, and they also allow for better load balancing across brokers.

#### Differentiate between Rabbitmq and Kafka.

- **Model**:
  - **RabbitMQ**: Messaging broker implementing the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). Primarily focused on routing and brokering.
  - **Kafka**: Distributed streaming platform. Primarily used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
- **Performance**:
  - **RabbitMQ**: Generally has lower latency but can be less efficient with very high throughput.
  - **Kafka**: Designed for high throughput and scalability. Usually performs better with massive data volumes.
- **Durability and Persistence**:
  - **RabbitMQ**: Provides configurable persistence options.
  - **Kafka**: Stores messages on disk and replicates within the cluster for fault-tolerance.
- **Message Ordering**:
  - **RabbitMQ**: Maintains order in a single queue.
  - **Kafka**: Maintains order within a partition.
- **Ease of Use**:
  - **RabbitMQ**: Often easier to set up and manage.
  - **Kafka**: Can be more complex, suitable for large-scale applications.

#### What are the guarantees that Kafka provides?

- **At-Least-Once**: Messages are guaranteed to be delivered at least once, but duplicates can occur.
- **Exactly-Once**: In certain configurations, Kafka can ensure that messages are delivered exactly once.
- **Ordered Processing**: Messages are maintained in order within individual partitions.

#### What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it?

An unbalanced cluster means that the partitions are unevenly distributed across the brokers in a Kafka cluster. This can lead to inefficient use of resources and performance issues.

#### Balancing It

You can balance an unbalanced Kafka cluster by:

- Using Kafka's built-in partition reassignment tool.
- Monitoring and managing broker resources, possibly automating reassignment to maintain balance.
- Properly setting up replication factors and partition counts during topic creation.

#### In your recent project, are you a producer or consumer or both?

#### In your recent project, Could you tell me your topic name?

#### In your recent project, How many brokers do you have? How many partitions for each topic? How many data for each topic.

#### In your recent project, which team produce what kind of event to you and you producer what kind of events?

#### What is offset?

An offset in Kafka is a unique identifier of a record within a partition. It allows consumers to keep track of messages and enables consuming messages from a specific point in the log.

By managing offsets, Kafka enables various consumption patterns, like replaying messages or picking up where a consumer left off after failure.
